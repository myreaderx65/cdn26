How much pleasure? Let's just say that I've scribbled my way through 21 pages so far, in under a day, just for the heck of it. If this prolific sensation isn't hypergraphia, a curious condition where you can't stop writing, it is at least somewhere in the same neurological neighborhood. \nThe device in question is the $399 Remarkable 2, a long-anticipated sequel to the world's first e-ink tablet. If you've encountered an e-ink screen before, it was probably on the Amazon Kindle. They are monochrome and much easier on the eye than a bright LED screen. You can use them in direct sunlight. E-ink is the closest thing the tech world has given us to regular pen on paper. \nThe first ReMarkable tablet, which launched in 2017 for $599, was widely praised for this paperlike quality. Yet it also came with a handful of flaws baked in. Its stylus (known as a \"marker\") was a little on the slow side, with a perceptible 40-millisecond delay between the marker touching the screen and its E-ink appearing. The bezel contained page-forward and page-back buttons, which were unfortunately placed at the bottom of the screen. Your wrist would have a hard time resting without accidentally pressing them.\nOn the ReMarkable 2, both flaws have been swept away. There is now a mere 20-millisecond wait for the ink to appear, a crucial threshold; to the human eye, it is immediate. The processor is twice as fast. Drawing on the tablet can be much more precise. Writing is more of a joy. (You can also do it for longer, given that the battery now reportedly lasts for two weeks instead of three days — I didn't get close to exhausting it — and recharges via USB-C rather than MicroUSB.) \nAs for the buttons on the bezel, they're gone. Now, you move between pages by swiping left or right. A single on-off button sits atop a thin silver strip on the left side of the tablet, a cool design that beats the cheaper, more plastic feel of the original. Combined with the world-record thinness of the ReMarkable 2, which is a mere 0.19 inches deep (versus 0.27 inches for its predecessor), the overall impression is of a magic legal pad from the 23rd century.\nIndeed, even though the Remarkable 2 is a shade heavier than its predecessor (405 grams versus 350 grams), the thinner, shorter design somehow helps it feel lighter. I was fond of writing on my lap while propping the top of the device up with a single finger. That's not something I could ever do with my iPad. \n\nSpeaking of the iPad, the ReMarkable 2 has taken a leaf out of Apple's book and filled up with magnets. The Remarkable stylus now clicks satisfyingly onto the side of the tablet — well, not quite as satisfyingly as the Apple Pencil sticks to the iPad Pro, but close. There's a key difference between the two markers that ReMarkable sells. The free one felt much more magnetic and re&#xadassuringly solid than the Marker Plus, which has an end that acts like an eraser. \nThe silver strip, meanwhile, magnetically attaches to a $69 folio case. However, I found the case useful only for storage; when writing, the cover was too stiff to bend back all the way, while the back added unnecessary bulk. Something like Apple's iPad smart cover, which folds back into a highly graspable triangular shape, would work wonders here.\nReMarkable's software, meanwhile, continues to improve by leaps and bounds. It now offers a variety of templates for each page, including storyboards, comics panels, and day planners. You can still upload PDF and EPUB files, mark them up, and save them to the ReMarkable cloud, which is accessible via app on smartphones and computers. Document sync (via WiFi) was a little on the slow side, in my experience, but never failed altogether. \nThe device's handwriting recognition is fast and fairly impressive, and I was surprised to find it could even read my cursive script — I grew up learning a fancy style known as copperplate, and it's still in my muscle memory — with relatively few errors. I had to make a dozen or so corrections to this article after converting it, and the errors were at least amusing: \"text\" became \"teat,\" \"feel\" became \"feet.\" This I can work with. \nAnnoyingly, there is only one thing you can do with your words once they've converted, and that is to email them. Sure, it's pretty cool to be able to dash off emails on a magic legal pad, but it would be nicer to be able to store the text. Given that everything else you write is automatically uploaded to the cloud, the lack of converted text storage is a strange omission. \nI had a few other minor gripes about the software. There isn't as much customization of the pen stroke as you'd expect. You only get the option of thin, medium, or thick lines, and it's Goldilocks' choice: thin is too fine for legibility, while thick is too bulky. Only medium is just about right. There's a greater selection of pen style, from mechanical pencil to ballpoint pen and paintbrush. Sometimes the brush strokes came out a little too jagged. Artists may love the ReMarkable 2 for its quick sketching utility but become frustrated if they try to use it as a fine art tool along the lines of an iPad.\nBut in the end, comparing this device to its far more expensive Apple brethren is a little like, well, apples and oranges. The ReMarkable 2 is the little e-ink tablet that would, from a small Norwegian company with big ambitions. The pandemic may have slowed its arrival — originally due to ship mid-summer, pre-orders have been delayed several times and are now expected to ship in September. Still, it is truly remarkable that this device exists at all. If you're looking to rediscover the joys of distraction-free writing by hand in a notebook that is practically infinite, there is nothing else like it on the market. \nHypergraphia, here we come. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1470420%252F7b44be1c-2680-4b7d-b6b5-1d93486a1a2f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=YOLCC_SGv3naFPgcuDaXjdTrYbg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ltlOqzMBoeA4fIH9cwVxupB3Ixg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=sEPaCydTM0yMYxxle8_7waj_S9o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F1600x720.jpg?signature=vYt4IPzLSJdFeTfMDfVqL8zsC4M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"ReMarkable 2 review: A magic legal pad from the future","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=sEPaCydTM0yMYxxle8_7waj_S9o=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.webp%252F800x360.webp?signature=pTE6xJsvl0T_wHUAMWGw4W5QRew=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F800x360.jpg?signature=sEPaCydTM0yMYxxle8_7waj_S9o=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"ReMarkable 2 review: A magic legal pad from the future","choice":true,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"productreview":[{"id":1470149,"data-id":1470149,"data-template":"default","data-product-url":"https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2","data-product-price":399,"data-product-name":"ReMarkable 2","data-product-good":"Stylus is magnetic,Slimmer, better design than its predecessor,Writing appears faster","data-product-bad":"Handwriting-to-text can't be edited,Folio cover isn't ideal,Limited usability for artists","data-product-blurb":"The world's first e-ink tablet has shed its flaws and is ready for prime time.","data-product-score":"4.75","data-product-coolness":5,"data-product-curve":"4.5","data-product-performance":"4.5","data-product-value":5,"data-product-score-title":"⚡ Mashable Score","data-product-coolness-title":"😎 Cool Factor","data-product-curve-title":"📘Learning Curve","data-product-performance-title":"💪Performance","data-product-bang-for-the-buck-title":"💵Bang for the Buck","class":"content-productreview"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The world's first e-ink tablet is now thinner, faster, and finally ready for prime time.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"ReMarkable 2 review: A magic legal pad from the future"}

To start, it's available on Polaroid's website for $99.99 with a 20-sheet printer cartridge costing $16.99 separately. You can also spend $129.99 for a starter set that comes with the printer and 40 sheets of paper. Other retailers, like Best Buy and Amazon, will have it on Sept. 10.\n\nSEE ALSO: For truly amazing Instagram photos, a point-and-shoot camera is a must\nIf Polaroid is to be believed, printing from the Hi-Print should be pretty simple. You connect to it via Bluetooth, choose and customize (with filters and text) what you want to print in an accompanying iOS or Android app, and let it rip. The images come out in the form of 2.3-inch by 3.4-inch wallet-friendly photos, but with adhesive backs so you can stick them wherever you please. Polaroid says printing takes less than a minute and claims the photos are water-resistant.\nThe battery is supposedly good for 20 prints before you need to charge it using a Micro-USB cable again. It looks tempting to just print the first 20 memes you find in your photo library, but remember it costs $17 to get more sheets. If you can restrain yourself and stomach the cost, Polaroid's new mobile printer could be a fun way to instantly decorate."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1465191%252F3ef2fd65-db55-45a2-8a66-12e65731c16f.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Mv5S1TovC1jdqMyYpRjtnW-BjS4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=gzPsH68EMzyHt33u18nkeBzcHU8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F280x158.png?signature=VYsARqz7bre2B1B26wl226-fSxs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F560x316.png?signature=_ls404XsXXXzyAKuwL1nBThEcxU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Polaroid's new mobile printer turns your iPhone photos into stickers","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F280x158.png?signature=VYsARqz7bre2B1B26wl226-fSxs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=sSq9nUqwx1eCWOK6tN_68vqPMh8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F280x158.png?signature=VYsARqz7bre2B1B26wl226-fSxs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Polaroid's new mobile printer turns your iPhone photos into stickers","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"That's not a rainbow-colored vape.

This one is from a product validation test batch, used for the last round of testing before the phone goes into mass production. Though it's unlikely, features could potentially still change or be removed. Still, this model is incredibly close to being finalized, and about as near as we can get right now to the iPhone that will be on shelves.\nFurther, this is only a look at the iPhone 12 Pro Max, so we don't know whether the iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro will have the same features.\nSEE ALSO: Apple's iPhone 12 Pro will have a silky smooth ProMotion display, report claims\nFirst up, this sneak peek confirms that the iPhone 12 Pro Max will likely have LiDAR assisted auto-focus, which measures distance using lasers. The phone will let you record video in 4K at 120 FPS, as well as slow motion 4K at 240FPS for those stunning bee videos and Jackass-style shenanigans.\nProsser also noted the enhanced night mode (which offers extended exposure times when the phone is on a steady surface), advanced noise reduction, and bit depth video support. Further, while he was unable to test it himself, Prosser's source told him the iPhone 12 Pro Max's facial recognition for Face ID is faster, and will work from more angles.\nThe leak further indicates that the iPhone 12 Pro Max's display settings will allow a 120hz screen refresh rate, as well as an option for the phone to automatically switch to 60hz depending upon what's being shown on the screen. However Prosser noted not all test phones have a 120hz refresh rate as an option, making it a bigger question as to whether this feature will actually end up in the finalized model.\niPhone 12 Pro details:True Depth array same size. Bezels are “noticeably thinner”Slightly larger display - making the notch “appear” smaller.Face ID works from wider angles. Even flat on a table.Sides are flat, but glass has slight curve.Rear cam module is 10% larger.— Jon Prosser (@jon_prosser) August 25, 2020\n\nProsser even shared some video of the iPhone 12 Pro Max, though not much is actually visible due to its phone case designed to prevent leaks. Fortunately, Prosser's source got a better look at the phone's design.\nAccording to the source, the iPhone 12 Pro Max's sides are flat, similar to the iPhone 5, but the edges of the display are slightly curved. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is also reportedly slightly lighter than the 11 Pro Max, despite the camera on the back being about 10 percent larger.\nNot everything could be hidden by the iPhone's anti-leak case either. Prosser also showed off a notable notch at the top of the screen, which appears a bit smaller than it is due to the phone's 6.7-inch screen and thinner bezels. However, it seems we'll have to wait a bit longer to see the iPhone 12's design for ourselves.\nRumours and speculation about the iPhone 12 have been swirling for a while now, with supply chain issues delaying launch beyond Apple's usual September reveal. Apple is currently expected to stagger the launch, releasing two 6.1-inch models first before following them with 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch models at a later date.\nWATCH: Our 5 favorite iOS 14 features, so far"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118563%252F80e22a60-7c58-4a4c-99e8-f819f1b00f27.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=MNAG8wPQlgvu-Hqlngk9-B13_EA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118563%252F80e22a60-7c58-4a4c-99e8-f819f1b00f27.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=Ar9fcxM_kEuitXBSNgvp6BCuwbc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118563%252F80e22a60-7c58-4a4c-99e8-f819f1b00f27.png%252F280x158.png?signature=UmbZQBafMR-TOIdKNfc1ac9T8UM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118563%252F80e22a60-7c58-4a4c-99e8-f819f1b00f27.png%252F560x316.png?signature=MD1NilkTCkfPtC9uGTcckvQ9h2I=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"iPhone 12 Pro Max leak appears to confirm rumored features including 120hz display, LiDAR auto-focus","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118563%252F80e22a60-7c58-4a4c-99e8-f819f1b00f27.png%252F280x158.png?signature=UmbZQBafMR-TOIdKNfc1ac9T8UM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118563%252F80e22a60-7c58-4a4c-99e8-f819f1b00f27.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=z6U63dbU1O5zIWWxhwuMGpZMR5g=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118563%252F80e22a60-7c58-4a4c-99e8-f819f1b00f27.png%252F280x158.png?signature=UmbZQBafMR-TOIdKNfc1ac9T8UM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"iPhone 12 Pro Max leak appears to confirm rumored features including 120hz display, LiDAR auto-focus","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"eGlvwQQJok","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Looks like some of those rumors are are becoming reality.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"iPhone 12 Pro Max leak appears to confirm rumored features including 120hz display, LiDAR auto-focus"},{"_id":"5f48c73bbfff31006000008d","id":"/article/facebook-apple-tax/","title":"Facebook tries to warn users about Apple 'tax,' Apple says no","title_tag":null,"author":"Stan Schroeder","post_date":"2020-08-28T08:58:34+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 08:58:34 +0000","formatted_date":"08/28/2020","sort_key":"1KbCw0","link":"https://mashable.com/article/facebook-apple-tax/","content":{"plain":"Apple and Facebook are clashing heads again. \nFacebook recently tried to inform its users that Apple is taking a 30 percent cut on Facebook's online events app, but Apple rejected the update, Reuters reported Friday. \nIn fact, Apple said no to Facebook twice. \nFirst, the social network asked Apple to waive its 30 percent fee, which it charges on in-app purchases, on Facebook's upcoming tool that would let users host paid online events. The idea behind the request was to offset losses incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, so Facebook wanted to pass on all revenue to users, but Apple declined.  \nThen, Facebook planned to launch the app with a notice saying that Apple has declined to waive its Apple Tax, as the 30 percent fee is sometimes called. However, Apple said no to that as well, citing an App Store rule that prohibits sharing \"irrelevant\" information with users. \n\"Don’t include irrelevant information, including but not limited to information about Apple or the development process,\" Apple's App Store guidelines say. \nA few weeks ago, Facebook released an image showing what this notice would look like. The iOS variant (on the left) says \"Apple takes 30 percent of this purchase,\" while the notice on Android (right) says that \"Facebook doesn't take a fee from this purchase.\" \nNotably, according to Reuters, the Android version doesn't display the notice, either. \n\nFacebook isn't giving up, though. \n\"Now more than ever, we should have the option to help people understand where money they intend for small businesses actually goes. Unfortunately Apple rejected our transparency notice around their 30 percent tax but we are still working to make that information available inside the app experience,\" Facebook told Reuters. \nSEE ALSO: Microsoft backs Epic Games, says Apple is threatening game development\nEarlier this month, the two companies had another public clash, as Facebook was forced to launch its Gaming app on iOS without games. Apple's stance was that the app breaks an App Store rule about apps whose main purpose is distributing games (only Apple is allowed to have such an app). Facebook responded by mocking Apple in its Android app, and calling out the company for \"hurting players and developers.\"\nApple's App Store guidelines and rules have been under increased scrutiny in the past weeks, with Apple removing popular game Fortnite from the App Store for bypassing the 30 percent cut with in-game currency, and Fortnite's publisher Epic Games answering with a lawsuit. \n\"Apple's removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100 percent monopoly over the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market,\" reads a legal complaint by Epic Games. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472018%252F25a27ca7-7333-42c3-8361-29684aadbef6.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=QnVqtBCMHYhV6S43CbPlnWIxnAY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=xuhJQvEUeB7rKAG61HgU3XLTDrU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=sF1GogeI2arxJWt4rZAUq6Js-QM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=n6zNpKLo_Rt_0OH5ORyvoRDjuuY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Facebook tries to warn users about Apple 'tax,' Apple says no","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=sF1GogeI2arxJWt4rZAUq6Js-QM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=CROHNfPtN8ZQqMkHERrXcLD2CWA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=sF1GogeI2arxJWt4rZAUq6Js-QM=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Facebook tries to warn users about Apple 'tax,' Apple says no","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It's on, now.

Rather than remove the tweet, Twitter will allow it to stand with some restrictions and a notice about how it violates the site's policies.\nWe placed a public interest notice on this Tweet for violating our Civic Integrity Policy for making misleading health claims that could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting. https://t.co/MA6E7mBpkm— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) August 23, 2020\n\nA follow-up tweet from Twitter Safety notes that the original tweet will be allowed to live on, just with limited engagements. That means no likes, no replies, and re-tweets without comment. It won't be deleted because most Trump tweets are considered relevant \"to ongoing public conversation\" by definition.\nSo now, anyone who looks at the newly flagged tweet will see a message sitting between it and the president's account info:\n\"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about civic and election integrity. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,\" the message reads, daring us not to laugh ruefully.\nWe're almost four years into this presidency and many have come to view Trump as a walking, talking, rage-filled manifestation of the \"old man yells at cloud\" meme. U.S. president or not, maybe it's time to re-think the old public interest rules. Eh, Twitter?\nThe company has taken an increasingly firm stance on Trump's social media behavior, which is to say multiple tweets emanating from the president's account have been flagged, but not removed, since May 2020. The latest flag marks the second time in recent months that Trump's dishonest portrayal of U.S. elections specifically has drawn Twitter's (again, incredibly mild) wrath."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=sCQOm-cdkFZbv5lxveWU9KG5Oxw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=B5-kT-gp7Vh9s74TPEcR-rTihlU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F280x158.jpg?signature=vjl6SFSFTBeY-EAcw1ONhFYRUKM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F560x316.jpg?signature=a2puhJYQzH3N5M7UmMjGsMlhG7M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Hey look, it's a day ending in 'y'!

Now the feature has been renamed, ditching the descriptive but clunky \"Retweets with comments\" for the cleaner \"Quote Tweets.\" \nQuote Tweets also appear between the Retweets and Likes on a tweet now, making the feature slightly less annoying to access. Previously, you had to click to see the Retweets, then click \"Retweets with comments\" from there. Now, you can just jump straight to the drama.\nThe update is live, with the official Twitter account announcing the changes on Monday. Also: \"The mask goes over your nose.\"\nThree things—1. \"Retweets with comments\" is changing to \"Quote Tweets\"2. Quote Tweets will appear right next to Retweets3.

The integration will allow creators to include links to their Teespring products directly in their videos.\nTikTokkers with hearty followings already frequently link to personal merchandise stores in their bios. Selling merch like clothing, as well as digital tutorials or templates, is a popular way for independent creators to earn cash from the people who consume their content for free. The new Teespring integration builds on what creators are already doing themselves with an official and more streamlined tool.\n\"Creators are the heart and soul of TikTok and we are constantly looking for ways to bring more value and opportunities for them within our platform,\" Sean Kim, TikTok's US head of product, told Mashable in an emailed statement. \"Teespring empowers creators to design and sell their own products, and this shared creator-first mindset made them the right partner for an e-commerce integration. We are looking forward to building upon our ongoing commitment to support creators through monetary opportunities and, in the meantime, are excited to see what ideas creators bring to life on Teespring.\"\nThe program is currently in beta testing, and will officially launch in September. Teespring is already working with 7,000+ creators and has invited some of them into a private beta. Creators who want to get the integration will have to meet eligibility criteria around the amount of followers they have and the content they produce.\nYou can see an example of what the new integration will look like through this post from TikTok user @bonnierzm: If you open the link in the TikTok app, a translucent gray box with a shopping bag icon with the words \"Limited edition shirt here\" appears, linked to BonnieRZM's Teespring store. As opposed to a Teespring link in bio, which takes users out of the app and to an external web page, clicking on the in-video link opens the store within TikTok itself. \n\nHaving shopping all in one place is a valuable tool for creators trying to sell products, because the fewer steps there are between your social media page and the \"buy\" — less friction in sales speak — the more it encourages people to make that purchase. That's something Facebook knows well, as it continues to make shopping in Instagram ever more integrated with the experience.\nWhat's not clear yet is what's in it for TikTok. The company has launched several initiatives to help its creators make money, including a $1 billion TikTok Creator Fund that it will allocate to users for their businesses over the next three years. However, TikTok and Teespring declined to answer whether the companies would make commissions on sales made through the integration. Teespring makes its money by actually providing and selling the products (whether physical or digital) to the owners of the customized stores. But what piece of the pie TikTok will get remains to be seen."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1476768%252F4fb50d73-5baa-4358-a6ad-8eded81626a1.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=Al5fQfQc0tUrpj-hegbI_btptIQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118754%252Fef27f65e-7c9f-4172-bd0b-cb9a3524114a.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=F-znu23fc4oA1c_y13c-J3Q_OyM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118754%252Fef27f65e-7c9f-4172-bd0b-cb9a3524114a.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=E-0vBPXYXrHUsgljW8KTwJLUoMY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118754%252Fef27f65e-7c9f-4172-bd0b-cb9a3524114a.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=0syE1mP_wDE40AQUbeIo__5_yNU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118754%252Fef27f65e-7c9f-4172-bd0b-cb9a3524114a.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=pJqpobrmMvMp__9OqlnPUKKifbE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118754%252Fef27f65e-7c9f-4172-bd0b-cb9a3524114a.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=jZUXFxO3ke1UvIdK3ARtgsVUBgw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"More commerce is coming to TikTok.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-tik-tok-commerce-teespring.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-tik-tok-commerce-teespring.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1476768%252F4fb50d73-5baa-4358-a6ad-8eded81626a1.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=4rQyCdeKEzZUBnyM8DixBCgPJ-8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1476768%252F4fb50d73-5baa-4358-a6ad-8eded81626a1.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=LSSiSUBYLwktvdPns49isDo0T2w=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"More commerce is coming to TikTok."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  Mario Tama/Getty Images"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"TikTok's new commerce integration lets creators start milkin' content for cash","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The commerce is coming to TikTok.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"TikTok's new commerce integration lets creators start milkin' content for cash"},{"_id":"5f4d56555084030076000002","id":"/article/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-approval/","title":"Amazon gets official approval to fly its delivery drones","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Kraus","post_date":"2020-08-31T19:58:11+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:58:11 +0000","formatted_date":" 7 hours ago","sort_key":"1KcPWr","link":"https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-approval/","content":{"plain":"It's a bird! It's a plane! It's an ... Amazon drone?\nAmazon has just gotten the thumbs up from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to start using its Prime Air drone fleet for customer deliveries. On Saturday, the FAA granted Amazon Part 135 Certification, which means the company has the go-ahead to use drones to \"safely and efficiently deliver packages to customers,\" according to a statement from the FAA.\nThat doesn't mean drones are going to start delivering packages immediately, per Amazon. Instead, it indicates that the FAA has reviewed all of Amazon's safety procedures, and the company has passed muster. The certification gives Amazon the ability to begin testing and scaling a system which would use drones to deliver lightweight packages in 30 minutes or less from order. \n\"This certification is an important step forward for Prime Air and indicates the FAA’s confidence in Amazon’s operating and safety procedures for an autonomous drone delivery service that will one day deliver packages to our customers around the world,\" David Carbon, Amazon's vice president of Prime Air, said. \"We will continue to develop and refine our technology to fully integrate delivery drones into the airspace, and work closely with the FAA and other regulators around the world to realize our vision of 30-minute delivery.”\nAmazon is the third company to receive the certification for commercial drone delivery, behind Alphabet's Wing and UPS Flight Forward. However, Wing and UPS are not shopping companies. That makes Amazon's certification notable: Amazon would own the whole purchasing chain from customer shopping to fulfillment via drone.\nThough Amazon has been working on drone delivery for years, it made significant progress last year when the company debuted its delivery drone in June 2019. The drone can deliver packages of under five pounds a distance of up to 15 miles in 30 minutes or less."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1476725%252F8d72e27e-d7bc-4afb-bd7e-24ede83416f6.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=F-0YvuYIsnD86Nk7s8RxFpnXOlc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118749%252F60dcdff6-943b-407a-b365-06e7a44c1655.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=3tUxB89_NwryyRrgTwtrv6ZrtBI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118749%252F60dcdff6-943b-407a-b365-06e7a44c1655.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=lTN_3_4J3_izZOqTgSxNSMyd5wk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118749%252F60dcdff6-943b-407a-b365-06e7a44c1655.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=iPnnWcunDbFAVI0UPcUKz6kqwjI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

get a Gotham City makeover until Oct. 31. Google-owned Waze is honoring 81 years of Batman with new \"characters\" and voices. \nPrevious fictional and real celebrities that have appeared on Waze: DJ Khaled and Sesame Street's Cookie Monster.\nIf you're feeling more Edward Nigma than Bruce Wayne, the villainous Riddler is also available in the app. While driving IRL, you can either see the Batmobile or Riddler Racer show up on the map.\nWaze's Batman tribute comes right after the first trailer for The Batman was released. The movie isn't expected in theaters until October 2021, but it's worth watching for a sneak peek of Paul Dano as the Riddler.\n\nSEE ALSO: Google Maps is back on Apple Watch after more than 3 years\nIn Waze, voice directions in English will feature actor Kevin Conroy as Batman and Wally Wingert as the Riddler. Conroy has voiced Batman in the Warner Bros. animated series since the 1990s, while actor Wingert was the voice for the Riddler in the Batman: Arkham video game series. Now the superhero and supervillain will tell you to turn left in 500 feet.\n\nSEE ALSO: DJ Khaled will get you there as the new voice on Waze\nThe Batman voices are only available in the English, Spanish, and Portuguese versions of the app. To customize your driving experience, open the app and select \"Drive with Batman.\"\nNo matter which DC character you choose, remember the wise words of Batman while driving: \"It’s not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.\"\nWATCH: 'The Batman' director Matt Reeves reveals images of the new

Work on your editing and audio production skills with the Adobe Premiere Pro CC Video and Audio Production Course bundle for $29.99, a 97% savings as of Aug. 31. \n\nWhile you might own impressive video equipment — drones, DSLRs, lighting, and heck, even your iPhone — if you don't know how to properly edit, your footage will never be as good as it could be. Even the best shot videos are useless if you can't piece them together. Fortunately, you can learn how to use Adobe Premiere Pro — the industry-standard editing software — from the comfort of your couch and get to grips with creative video and audio production. All you need is $30 and about 30 hours to learn at your leisure.\nThe Adobe Premiere Pro CC Video and Audio Production Course Bundle features six courses, broken down into 340 lessons, packed with everything you need to know to start editing with Premiere Pro. A master class taught by Adobe Certified Instructor Daniel Scott will walk you through the very basics, up to the shortcuts and techniques the pros use. You'll even work on mini projects and assignments you can add to your portfolio. Another crash course, led by life coach and best-selling instructor Joe Parys, explores speed manipulation and transitioning, while Invert Media Founder Bryan Guerra's course shows you how to add special effects, graphics, text, and more to your videos.\nBeyond editing video footage, you'll also take a deep dive into audio mixing and voice processing. In a course led by Tomas George, a music producer and audio engineer, you'll learn professional audio processing tools and techniques, like EQ essentials, DeNoise, DeReverb, compression, and more. By the end of all six courses, the complicated interface of Premiere Pro won't look so intimidating. Heck, you may even be able to launch that YouTube channel you've been dreaming up. \nEach course in this bundle is valued at $199 a pop. But for a limited time, you can snag the whole collection for just $29.99 (97% off).\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              The

its new ARM-based chips to good use. \nAccording to a report by The China Times (via MacRumors), Apple is planning to launch a 12-inch MacBook powered by its new A14X chip near year's end. \nThe report, which cites sources from Apple's supply chain, claims the device will have a USB-C slot (no surprise there) and weigh less than one kilogram, which is made possible by the low-power ARM-based processor. It will have a battery life of 15-20 hours. \nThis same chip will be used in the next generation iPad Pro, the report claims. \nApple's transition from Intel chips to Apple-branded, ARM-based silicon was made public during this year's WWDC conference in June. Apple said the first Mac to include the new chip should ship before the end of 2020, but hasn't provided any other details. \nSEE ALSO: Apple now gives customers a full year to buy AppleCare+\nIf accurate, the report would mean the return of Apple's 12-inch MacBook, which was replaced by MacBook Air last year. The prospect of having to deal with just one USB-C port is scary, but the extreme portability and battery life sound very appealing. \nOver the year, we've heard various rumors about potential Macs with Apple silicon. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in June that Apple will launch an ARM-based, 13.3-inch MacBook Pro in late 2020 or early 2021, but he also said an ARM-based, 24-inch iMac is possible in the same timeframe. The China Times' report says an iMac sporting Apple silicon will come next year, armed with a powerful, custom-designed graphics card which will replaced the AMD GPUs typically found in iMacs. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=m3TEEoRo3DdSdbQiZTfrjw0PVcY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=S7XoXeyFw9ib51hAUZsnWlh1PbE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=44-0BizrccdoaVfwBpzG3tjViAA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=KwQct-epDgQTaPWNpoMNQ3z6FYY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=j4p06kQueIA57SMf4A5v3rarR6A=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=L4Rk5q-dd13DxPYky52gNCc-Z6w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Ultra-light MacBook with Apple chip is reportedly coming this year","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=44-0BizrccdoaVfwBpzG3tjViAA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=PW7Rok1utdLgWPjjaCyx8Riy7Vo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=Xb3MqtTFar_LqCK3HR_66zlgoQk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=j4p06kQueIA57SMf4A5v3rarR6A=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118730%252Fe62af0fd-c484-4461-8a35-3c66be4efce3.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=44-0BizrccdoaVfwBpzG3tjViAA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Ultra-light MacBook with Apple chip is reportedly coming this year","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It will be the most compact laptop in Apple's lineup.

The device will be available on AT&T \"soon\", the company says, and on Verizon in early October.\nIt's the newest in a nascent, but noteworthy, market for mid-range 5G smartphones, alongside the $600 Samsung Galaxy A71 5G and the $500 Google Pixel 4a 5G, which is set to launch later this year, as well.\n\nWe haven't gotten our hands on the One 5G yet, but it could be pretty good value regardless of whether or not you use 5G religiously. \nIt's got a 6.7-inch display with HDR10 support and a 90Hz refresh rate, making its screen a step up from the recently released Pixel 4a (which has a 5.8-inch display). Additionally, the 48MP quadruple rear camera array features a wide angle lens and a macro lens with its own ring light instead of the normal flash bulb. \nOh yeah, there are two selfie cameras, too. One of them lets you take wide angle shots for whenever we can get together in large groups again. The 5,000mAh battery should keep it alive for a while between charges, but its 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage might be examples of how Motorola kept the price down. Last but certainly not least, the Motorola One 5G comes with a headphone jack.\nAgain, specs only tell us so much before we get to actually use a new phone. But until then, the Motorola One 5G is something to keep in mind for those who want a new phone this fall but don't want to pay Apple or Samsung prices."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=25TGolD1hJwqzEf_5BXwaGI3--o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=Om6IPjMcX8575lxAq_ztwu2WwE8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F356x205.png?signature=kSmo456OtZ-aAS2vWqYB0oWedx8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F712x410.png?signature=9YGlAPPhbyjt47DcDfc2FN9v1CY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F280x157.png?signature=LFIj91mnEvdQ2hIDshOo6E4iQTo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F560x314.png?signature=KWCLIQC78b6n4ek5gvHsfPSTeVQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Motorola One 5G brings quadruple rear cameras and 5G support for less than $500","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F356x205.png?signature=kSmo456OtZ-aAS2vWqYB0oWedx8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=XEJo86Dct2bM58uup4mbOPjWcp0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=cQV3NY6AqczG3ExY0UaJiNaiUBQ=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F280x157.png?signature=LFIj91mnEvdQ2hIDshOo6E4iQTo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118599%252F705f0981-b8e1-41b8-b0d8-9d784e5b61cb.png%252F356x205.png?signature=kSmo456OtZ-aAS2vWqYB0oWedx8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Motorola One 5G brings quadruple rear cameras and 5G support for less than $500","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Cheap 5G phones are finally here.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Motorola One 5G brings quadruple rear cameras and 5G support for less than $500"},{"_id":"5f4cca8fb4c8ee0040000001","id":"/article/how-to-avoid-algorithms-facebook-youtube-twitter-instagram/","title":"Algorithms control your online life.

Depending on the result of the U.S. presidential election, it may give us one more. Either way, it's high time we questioned the impact of these high-tech data-driven calculations, which increasingly determine who or what we see (and what we don't) online. \nThe impact of algorithms is starting to scale up to a dizzying degree, and literally billions of people are feeling the ripple effects. This is the year the Social Credit System, an ominous Black Mirror-like \"behavior score\" run by the Chinese government, is set to officially launch. It may not be quite as bad as you've heard, but it will boost or tighten financial credit and other incentives for the entire population. There's another billion unexamined, unimpeachable algorithms hanging over a billion human lives.   \nIn the UK, few will forget this year's A-level algorithm. A-levels are key exams for 18-year olds; they make or break college offers. COVID-19 canceled them. Teachers were asked what each pupil would have scored. But the government fed these numbers into an algorithm alongside the school's past performance. Result: 40 percent of all teacher estimates were downgraded, which nixed college for high-achieving kids in disadvantaged areas. Boris Johnson backed down, eventually, blaming a \"mutant algorithm.\" Still, even a former colleague of the prime minister thinks the A-level fiasco may torpedo his reelection chances. \nIn the U.S., we don't tend to think about shadowy government algorithms running or ruining our lives. Well, not unless you're a defendant in one of the states where algorithms predict your likelihood of committing more crime (eat your heart out, Minority Report) and advise judges on sentencing. U.S. criminal justice algorithms, it probably won't surprise you to learn, are operated by for-profit companies and stand accused of perpetuating racism. Such as  COMPAS in Florida and Wisconsin, which ProPublica found was twice as likely to label Black defendants \"high risk\" than white defendants — and was wrong about 40 percent of the time. \nThe flaws in such \"mutant algorithms,\" of course, reflect their all-too-human designers. Math itself isn't racist, or classist, or authoritarian. An algorithm is just a set of instructions. Technically, the recipe book in your kitchen is full of them. As with any recipe, the quality of an algorithm depends on its ingredients — and those of us who have to eat the result really don't think enough about what went on in the kitchen. \n\"All around us, algorithms provide a kind of convenient source of authority, an easy way to delegate responsibility; a short cut that we take without thinking,\" writes mathematician Hannah Fry in her 2018 book Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms. \"Who is really going to click through to the second page of Google every time and think critically about every result?\"\nTry to live without algorithms entirely, however, and you'll soon notice their absence. Algorithms are often effective because they are able to calculate multiple probabilities faster and more effectively than any human mind. Anyone who's ever spent longer on the road because they thought they could outsmart Google Maps' directions knows the truth of this. This thought experiment imagining a day without algorithms ended in terrible gridlock, since even traffic-light systems use them. \nStill, you would be right to be concerned about the influence algorithms have on our internet lives — particularly in the area of online content. The more scientists study the matter, the more it seems that popular search, video and social media algorithms are governing our brains. Studies have shown they can alter our mood (Facebook itself proved that one) and yes, even our 2016 votes (which explains why the Trump campaign is investing so much into Facebook ads this time around). \nSo before we find out the full effect of algorithms in 2020 let's take a look at the algorithms on each of the major content services — many of which are surprisingly easy to erase from our lives. \n1. Facebook\nNo algorithm on Earth, not even China's Social Credit system, has the power of Mark Zuckerberg's. Every day, nearly 2 billion people visit Facebook. Nearly all of them allow the algorithm to present posts in the order that the company has determined most likely to keep them engaged. That means you see a lot more posts from friends you've engaged with in the past, regardless of how close you actually are to them. It also means content that causes big back-and-forth fights is pushed to the top. And Zuckerberg knows it. \n\"Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness,\" warned a 2018 internal Facebook study, unearthed by the Wall Street Journal. Left unchecked, these mutant algorithms would favor \"more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention & increase time on the platform.\" \nZuckerberg, reportedly afraid that conservatives would be disproportionately affected if he tweaked the algorithm to surface more harmonious posts, shelved the study. It's been a good four years for conservatives on Facebook, who have been playing the referee ever since they petitioned Zuckerberg to stop using human editors to curate news in 2016. Now look at Facebook's top performing posts in 2020; on a daily basis, the list is dominated by names such as Ben Shapiro, Franklin Graham, and Sean Hannity. \nBut even conservatives have cause to be disquieted by the Facebook algorithm. Seeing friends' popular posts has been shown to make us more depressed. Facebook addiction is heavily correlated with depressive disorder. So-called \"super sharers\" drown out less active users, according to the 2018 report; an executive who tried to reduce the super-sharer influence on the algorithm abruptly left the company.\nHow to fix it \n\nLuckily, you can reduce their influence yourself. Because Facebook still allows you to remove the sorting algorithm from your timeline, and simply view all posts from all your friends and follows in reverse chronological order (that is, most recently posted at the top). On Facebook.com, click the three dots next to \"News Feed,\" then click \"most recent.\" On the app, you'll need to click \"settings,\" then \"see more,\" then \"most recent.\"\nThe result? Well, you might be surprised to catch up with old friends you'd almost forgotten about. And if you interact with their posts, you're training the content algorithm for when you go back to your regular timeline. In my experience, reverse chronological order isn't the most thrilling way to browse Facebook — the algorithm knows what it's doing, locking your brain in with the most exciting posts — but it's a nice corrective. If you're one of the two billion on Facebook every day, try this version at least once a week. \n2. YouTube\nThe YouTube \"watch next\" algorithm may be even more damaging to democracy than Facebook's preference for controversial posts. Some 70 percent of YouTube videos we consume were recommended by the service's algorithm, which is optimized to make you watch more YouTube videos and ads no matter what (the average viewing session is now above one hour). \nThat means YouTube prioritizes controversial content, because whether you love it or hate it, you'll keep watching. And once you've watched one piece of controversial content, the algorithm will assume that's what you're into, steering you to the kind of stuff viewers of that video opted to watch next. Which explains how your grandparents can start by watching one relatively innocuous Fox News video and end up going down a QAnon conspiracy theory rabbit hole. \nA former Google programmer, Guillaime Chaslot, found the YouTube algorithm may have been biased enough to swing the outcome of the 2016 election, which was decided by 77,000 votes in three states. \"More than 80 percent of recommended videos were favorable to Trump, whether the initial query was 'Trump' or 'Clinton',\" he wrote in the immediate aftermath. \"A large proportion of these recommendations were divisive and fake news.\" Similarly, Chaslot found that 90 percent of videos recommended from the search query \"is the Earth flat?\" said that yes, indeed it is. \nThis isn't just a problem in the U.S. One of the most important case studies of the YouTube algorithm's political impact was in Brazil, where fringe right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro was elected president after unexpectedly becoming a YouTube star. \"YouTube’s search and recommendation system appears to have systematically diverted users to far-right and conspiracy channels in Brazil,\" a 2019 New York Times investigation found. Even Bolsonaro's allies credited YouTube for his win. \nHow to fix it\n\nTurning off autoplay, an option next to the \"Up Next\"  list, will at least stop you from blindly watching whatever the YouTube algorithm recommends. You can't turn off recommendations altogether, but you can at least warn less tech-savvy relatives that the algorithm is doing its level best to radicalize them in service of views. \nChaslot's nonprofit algotransparency.org will show you what videos are most recommended across the site on any given day. By now, you may not be surprised to see that Fox News content tends to float to the top. Your YouTube recommendation algorithm may look normal to you if it's had years to learn your likes and dislikes. But a brand-new user will see something else entirely.  \n3. Instagram\nWhile parent company Facebook allows you to view your feed in reverse chronological order, Instagram banished that option altogether back in 2016 — leading to a variety of conspiracy theories about \"shadow banning.\" It will still show you every photo and story if you keep scrolling for long enough, but certain names float to the top so frequently that you'd be forgiven for feeling like a stalker. (Hello, Instagram crushes!) \nHow to fix it\n\nAs of a February update, Instagram will at least let you see who you've been inadvertently ignoring. Click on your profile icon in the bottom right corner, click on your \"following\" number, and you'll see two categories: \"Least Interacted With\" and \"Most Shown In Feed.\" Click on the former, scroll through the list, and give your most ignored follows some love. \nSEE ALSO: How tech companies can turn 'commitments' to diversity into action\nYou can also sort your feed by the order in which you followed accounts, which is truly infuriating. Why offer that option, and not just give us a straight-up chronological feed? Instagram is also said to be testing a \"Latest posts\" feature that will catch you up on recent happenings, but this hasn't rolled out to all users yet. \n4. Twitter\nJust like its social media rivals, Twitter is obsessed with figuring out how it can present information in anything other than most recent order — the format that Twitter has long been known for. Founder Jack Dorsey has introduced solutions that will allow you to follow topics, not just people, and to show you tweets in your timeline that drove the most engagement first. \nHow to fix it\n\nAll of these non-chronological tweaks fall under the \"Home\" heading at the top of the page. Click the star icons next to it, and you'll have the opportunity to go back to traditional Twitter-style \"Latest Tweets.\" Of all the social media services, Twitter is the one that makes it easiest to ignore its recommendation algorithm. \nIt may take a little more scrolling to find the good stuff on Latest Tweets, and of course what you're seeing depends on what time of day you're dipping into the timeline. Still, Latest Tweets is your best bet for a range of opinions and information from your follows unimpeded by any mutant algorithms.  "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472420%252F538c8ef8-681e-4c86-b32f-2cc47469a121.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=2vVd3-k2XGvOpobWClYtaAjY_Ws=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=s9I1yeflcOCfDDOE6qCSeK6UlAU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F356x205.png?signature=RcDXqljTGEhm9euThdkEZYlGrYM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F712x410.png?signature=CM_sbMznKqvn1S-3YsMG16SspwY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F280x157.png?signature=I0XInR97T-DCpfVMz45x4Js1Blc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F560x314.png?signature=cwFPDGPmhEX_Qgr_b0an5Rp3S4A=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Social media algorithms train your brain by reinforcing and radicalizing what you like and love.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-how-to-avoid-algorithms-facebook-youtube-twitter-instagram.png","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-how-to-avoid-algorithms-facebook-youtube-twitter-instagram.png","micro":1},"src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472420%252F538c8ef8-681e-4c86-b32f-2cc47469a121.png%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=JIgU2cpZoORlkjKdnaLQdn5pdxw=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472420%252F538c8ef8-681e-4c86-b32f-2cc47469a121.png%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=u6_8iW7FXYZRffeGThYiIUB_jo4=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Social media algorithms train your brain by reinforcing and radicalizing what you like and love."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  MASHABLE COMPOSITE: ISTOCK / JOLYGON / GETTY PLUS"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Algorithms control your online life.

No monthly fees involved!\n\nThe only thing worse than losing all of your precious photos, videos, and files from over the years is knowing it could've been prevented. If you only store your stuff on your computer or smartphone, you can easily lose it all forever with no way of recovery – whether from a crash, a failed software update, theft, or just a freak accident. In other words: you need a backup. \nYou could invest in an external hard drive, but you'll still have to remember to plug it in to back up your documents and photos. And if you drop it, bad things could happen. A more convenient and practically mindless solution is cloud storage. There are a variety of options on the market, like Dropbox, iCloud, or Google Drive, which offer free versions of their basic subscriptions. But these are made for people who only need a small amount of storage — not those who want to back up all those concert videos from over the years and relive them in isolation. For more storage, you'll likely pay a hefty fee month after month.\nInstead, why not pay a low one-time fee and get more storage than you could ever need, so you never have to worry about it again? Genius, right?\nEnter: Degoo Premium. You can get up to 10TB of backup space for life, which is kept under lock and key with ultra-secure 256-bit AES encryption. That means nobody can see it except you — unless you want them to, of course. You can easily send files to friends and family via email or link. And the best part? Degoo automatically detects changes in your files and updates them on the spot, so you don't constantly have to. It's practically a no-brainer. \nGet a massive 10TB of cloud storage — more than Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive combined – with a lifetime subscription to Degoo Premium, on sale for just $149 (worth $3,600) for a limited time.\n\n            \n              \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Degoo Premium: Lifetime 10TB Backup Plan — $149\n              See Details"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472299%252Fdc6e0aea-f744-404c-9f50-ce889f4f671a.jpeg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpeg?signature=4zjIIjt7qiTtFuowV6crJs2iZfc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118695%252Fc51f4d97-7dea-48dc-8662-4b9358ae0fff.jpeg%252F1438x0.jpeg?signature=vTSkYYyBpbpwxyF-qK_F4O0LUTg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118695%252Fc51f4d97-7dea-48dc-8662-4b9358ae0fff.jpeg%252F356x205.jpeg?signature=ou0VO1sHU_QXYJ5wFNDcoOQr4Ts=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118695%252Fc51f4d97-7dea-48dc-8662-4b9358ae0fff.jpeg%252F712x410.jpeg?signature=Luet8z7jMOYIHWrJLqoDp5_JrMw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118695%252Fc51f4d97-7dea-48dc-8662-4b9358ae0fff.jpeg%252F280x157.jpeg?signature=wkk3-bIbPhvg8g8ygRDOSo6a2M0=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118695%252Fc51f4d97-7dea-48dc-8662-4b9358ae0fff.jpeg%252F560x314.jpeg?signature=T8JALJWvYP-FJsUOb07_6CqaKTU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"This Degoo lifetime backup plan provides you with 10TB of space for data.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-aug-31-degoo-premium-backup-plan.jpeg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-aug-31-degoo-premium-backup-plan.jpeg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpeg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472299%252Fdc6e0aea-f744-404c-9f50-ce889f4f671a.jpeg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpeg?signature=wCBnBNP3BJMXiuR3qy44T60ZtIY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472299%252Fdc6e0aea-f744-404c-9f50-ce889f4f671a.jpeg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpeg?signature=HGCKfPm82ShYLBKp255-IqXDh_M=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"This Degoo lifetime backup plan provides you with 10TB of space for data."}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  degoo backup"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Get 10TB of cloud storage for *life* for just $149","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"buy_cta":[{"data-product-url":"https://zdcs.link/M1rPm","data-product-name":"Degoo Premium: Lifetime 10TB Backup Plan — $149","data-product-img":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472298%252F512f8fbc-baf6-47dc-951d-98b7695c043a.jpeg%252Ffit-in__675x0.jpeg?signature=gWuFLwM2zkoI0qMAxkBS1l1omUw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","data-product-img-credit":"degoo backup"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"If you've done the research, you know this is an amazing deal.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Get 10TB of cloud storage for *life* for just $149"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":52442}

How much pleasure? Let's just say that I've scribbled my way through 21 pages so far, in under a day, just for the heck of it. If this prolific sensation isn't hypergraphia, a curious condition where you can't stop writing, it is at least somewhere in the same neurological neighborhood. \nThe device in question is the $399 Remarkable 2, a long-anticipated sequel to the world's first e-ink tablet. If you've encountered an e-ink screen before, it was probably on the Amazon Kindle. They are monochrome and much easier on the eye than a bright LED screen. You can use them in direct sunlight. E-ink is the closest thing the tech world has given us to regular pen on paper. \nThe first ReMarkable tablet, which launched in 2017 for $599, was widely praised for this paperlike quality. Yet it also came with a handful of flaws baked in. Its stylus (known as a \"marker\") was a little on the slow side, with a perceptible 40-millisecond delay between the marker touching the screen and its E-ink appearing. The bezel contained page-forward and page-back buttons, which were unfortunately placed at the bottom of the screen. Your wrist would have a hard time resting without accidentally pressing them.\nOn the ReMarkable 2, both flaws have been swept away. There is now a mere 20-millisecond wait for the ink to appear, a crucial threshold; to the human eye, it is immediate. The processor is twice as fast. Drawing on the tablet can be much more precise. Writing is more of a joy. (You can also do it for longer, given that the battery now reportedly lasts for two weeks instead of three days — I didn't get close to exhausting it — and recharges via USB-C rather than MicroUSB.) \nAs for the buttons on the bezel, they're gone. Now, you move between pages by swiping left or right. A single on-off button sits atop a thin silver strip on the left side of the tablet, a cool design that beats the cheaper, more plastic feel of the original. Combined with the world-record thinness of the ReMarkable 2, which is a mere 0.19 inches deep (versus 0.27 inches for its predecessor), the overall impression is of a magic legal pad from the 23rd century.\nIndeed, even though the Remarkable 2 is a shade heavier than its predecessor (405 grams versus 350 grams), the thinner, shorter design somehow helps it feel lighter. I was fond of writing on my lap while propping the top of the device up with a single finger. That's not something I could ever do with my iPad. \n\nSpeaking of the iPad, the ReMarkable 2 has taken a leaf out of Apple's book and filled up with magnets. The Remarkable stylus now clicks satisfyingly onto the side of the tablet — well, not quite as satisfyingly as the Apple Pencil sticks to the iPad Pro, but close. There's a key difference between the two markers that ReMarkable sells. The free one felt much more magnetic and re&#xadassuringly solid than the Marker Plus, which has an end that acts like an eraser. \nThe silver strip, meanwhile, magnetically attaches to a $69 folio case. However, I found the case useful only for storage; when writing, the cover was too stiff to bend back all the way, while the back added unnecessary bulk. Something like Apple's iPad smart cover, which folds back into a highly graspable triangular shape, would work wonders here.\nReMarkable's software, meanwhile, continues to improve by leaps and bounds. It now offers a variety of templates for each page, including storyboards, comics panels, and day planners. You can still upload PDF and EPUB files, mark them up, and save them to the ReMarkable cloud, which is accessible via app on smartphones and computers. Document sync (via WiFi) was a little on the slow side, in my experience, but never failed altogether. \nThe device's handwriting recognition is fast and fairly impressive, and I was surprised to find it could even read my cursive script — I grew up learning a fancy style known as copperplate, and it's still in my muscle memory — with relatively few errors. I had to make a dozen or so corrections to this article after converting it, and the errors were at least amusing: \"text\" became \"teat,\" \"feel\" became \"feet.\" This I can work with. \nAnnoyingly, there is only one thing you can do with your words once they've converted, and that is to email them. Sure, it's pretty cool to be able to dash off emails on a magic legal pad, but it would be nicer to be able to store the text. Given that everything else you write is automatically uploaded to the cloud, the lack of converted text storage is a strange omission. \nI had a few other minor gripes about the software. There isn't as much customization of the pen stroke as you'd expect. You only get the option of thin, medium, or thick lines, and it's Goldilocks' choice: thin is too fine for legibility, while thick is too bulky. Only medium is just about right. There's a greater selection of pen style, from mechanical pencil to ballpoint pen and paintbrush. Sometimes the brush strokes came out a little too jagged. Artists may love the ReMarkable 2 for its quick sketching utility but become frustrated if they try to use it as a fine art tool along the lines of an iPad.\nBut in the end, comparing this device to its far more expensive Apple brethren is a little like, well, apples and oranges. The ReMarkable 2 is the little e-ink tablet that would, from a small Norwegian company with big ambitions. The pandemic may have slowed its arrival — originally due to ship mid-summer, pre-orders have been delayed several times and are now expected to ship in September. Still, it is truly remarkable that this device exists at all. If you're looking to rediscover the joys of distraction-free writing by hand in a notebook that is practically infinite, there is nothing else like it on the market. \nHypergraphia, here we come. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1470420%252F7b44be1c-2680-4b7d-b6b5-1d93486a1a2f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=YOLCC_SGv3naFPgcuDaXjdTrYbg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ltlOqzMBoeA4fIH9cwVxupB3Ixg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=zlrfc0gbV9-FnLbqJTGdXxNPg9M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=L_2HWkbfCeMOURnNLC5HNFGy_Sc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

put on your laptop, Polaroid just came through in the clutch.\nPolaroid announced the launch of its new Hi-Print mobile printer on Monday morning. To start, it's available on Polaroid's website for $99.99 with a 20-sheet printer cartridge costing $16.99 separately. You can also spend $129.99 for a starter set that comes with the printer and 40 sheets of paper. Other retailers, like Best Buy and Amazon, will have it on Sept. 10.\n\nSEE ALSO: For truly amazing Instagram photos, a point-and-shoot camera is a must\nIf Polaroid is to be believed, printing from the Hi-Print should be pretty simple. You connect to it via Bluetooth, choose and customize (with filters and text) what you want to print in an accompanying iOS or Android app, and let it rip. The images come out in the form of 2.3-inch by 3.4-inch wallet-friendly photos, but with adhesive backs so you can stick them wherever you please. Polaroid says printing takes less than a minute and claims the photos are water-resistant.\nThe battery is supposedly good for 20 prints before you need to charge it using a Micro-USB cable again. It looks tempting to just print the first 20 memes you find in your photo library, but remember it costs $17 to get more sheets. If you can restrain yourself and stomach the cost, Polaroid's new mobile printer could be a fun way to instantly decorate."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1465191%252F3ef2fd65-db55-45a2-8a66-12e65731c16f.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=Mv5S1TovC1jdqMyYpRjtnW-BjS4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=gzPsH68EMzyHt33u18nkeBzcHU8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F356x205.png?signature=yvpA12tfOPdvnkQAQr1EUOIn-kc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F712x410.png?signature=OHU00UpTT5r-qbvEXyeevPjqziY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F280x157.png?signature=bpdeYxddP2Hget-JXaJMFNDmUyc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F560x314.png?signature=UrcHAcml-HahjKBWZ6IcIgTZztU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Polaroid's new mobile printer turns your iPhone photos into stickers","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F356x205.png?signature=yvpA12tfOPdvnkQAQr1EUOIn-kc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=wkC18xqvGcOhFkt1Av3SmvkPdrc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=gPrgvL8N4XOp_IInbJL-AgDSYAc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F280x157.png?signature=bpdeYxddP2Hget-JXaJMFNDmUyc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118481%252F1fbc3896-9e8e-4d30-8d35-e4ddc4e5ed75.png%252F356x205.png?signature=yvpA12tfOPdvnkQAQr1EUOIn-kc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Polaroid's new mobile printer turns your iPhone photos into stickers","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"That's not a rainbow-colored vape.

This one is from a product validation test batch, used for the last round of testing before the phone goes into mass production. Though it's unlikely, features could potentially still change or be removed. Still, this model is incredibly close to being finalized, and about as near as we can get right now to the iPhone that will be on shelves.\nFurther, this is only a look at the iPhone 12 Pro Max, so we don't know whether the iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro will have the same features.\nSEE ALSO: Apple's iPhone 12 Pro will have a silky smooth ProMotion display, report claims\nFirst up, this sneak peek confirms that the iPhone 12 Pro Max will likely have LiDAR assisted auto-focus, which measures distance using lasers. The phone will let you record video in 4K at 120 FPS, as well as slow motion 4K at 240FPS for those stunning bee videos and Jackass-style shenanigans.\nProsser also noted the enhanced night mode (which offers extended exposure times when the phone is on a steady surface), advanced noise reduction, and bit depth video support. Further, while he was unable to test it himself, Prosser's source told him the iPhone 12 Pro Max's facial recognition for Face ID is faster, and will work from more angles.\nThe leak further indicates that the iPhone 12 Pro Max's display settings will allow a 120hz screen refresh rate, as well as an option for the phone to automatically switch to 60hz depending upon what's being shown on the screen. However Prosser noted not all test phones have a 120hz refresh rate as an option, making it a bigger question as to whether this feature will actually end up in the finalized model.\niPhone 12 Pro details:True Depth array same size. Bezels are “noticeably thinner”Slightly larger display - making the notch “appear” smaller.Face ID works from wider angles. Even flat on a table.Sides are flat, but glass has slight curve.Rear cam module is 10% larger.— Jon Prosser (@jon_prosser) August 25, 2020\n\nProsser even shared some video of the iPhone 12 Pro Max, though not much is actually visible due to its phone case designed to prevent leaks. Fortunately, Prosser's source got a better look at the phone's design.\nAccording to the source, the iPhone 12 Pro Max's sides are flat, similar to the iPhone 5, but the edges of the display are slightly curved. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is also reportedly slightly lighter than the 11 Pro Max, despite the camera on the back being about 10 percent larger.\nNot everything could be hidden by the iPhone's anti-leak case either. Prosser also showed off a notable notch at the top of the screen, which appears a bit smaller than it is due to the phone's 6.7-inch screen and thinner bezels. However, it seems we'll have to wait a bit longer to see the iPhone 12's design for ourselves.\nRumours and speculation about the iPhone 12 have been swirling for a while now, with supply chain issues delaying launch beyond Apple's usual September reveal. Apple is currently expected to stagger the launch, releasing two 6.1-inch models first before following them with 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch models at a later date.\nWATCH: Our 5 favorite iOS 14 features,

tried to inform its users that Apple is taking a 30 percent cut on Facebook's online events app, but Apple rejected the update, Reuters reported Friday. \nIn fact, Apple said no to Facebook twice. \nFirst, the social network asked Apple to waive its 30 percent fee, which it charges on in-app purchases, on Facebook's upcoming tool that would let users host paid online events. The idea behind the request was to offset losses incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, so Facebook wanted to pass on all revenue to users, but Apple declined.  \nThen, Facebook planned to launch the app with a notice saying that Apple has declined to waive its Apple Tax, as the 30 percent fee is sometimes called. However, Apple said no to that as well, citing an App Store rule that prohibits sharing \"irrelevant\" information with users. \n\"Don’t include irrelevant information, including but not limited to information about Apple or the development process,\" Apple's App Store guidelines say. \nA few weeks ago, Facebook released an image showing what this notice would look like. The iOS variant (on the left) says \"Apple takes 30 percent of this purchase,\" while the notice on Android (right) says that \"Facebook doesn't take a fee from this purchase.\" \nNotably, according to Reuters, the Android version doesn't display the notice, either. \n\nFacebook isn't giving up, though. \n\"Now more than ever, we should have the option to help people understand where money they intend for small businesses actually goes. Unfortunately Apple rejected our transparency notice around their 30 percent tax but we are still working to make that information available inside the app experience,\" Facebook told Reuters. \nSEE ALSO: Microsoft backs Epic Games, says Apple is threatening game development\nEarlier this month, the two companies had another public clash, as Facebook was forced to launch its Gaming app on iOS without games. Apple's stance was that the app breaks an App Store rule about apps whose main purpose is distributing games (only Apple is allowed to have such an app). Facebook responded by mocking Apple in its Android app, and calling out the company for \"hurting players and developers.\"\nApple's App Store guidelines and rules have been under increased scrutiny in the past weeks, with Apple removing popular game Fortnite from the App Store for bypassing the 30 percent cut with in-game currency, and Fortnite's publisher Epic Games answering with a lawsuit. \n\"Apple's removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100 percent monopoly over the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market,\" reads a legal complaint by Epic Games. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472018%252F25a27ca7-7333-42c3-8361-29684aadbef6.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=QnVqtBCMHYhV6S43CbPlnWIxnAY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=xuhJQvEUeB7rKAG61HgU3XLTDrU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ZnsD1MrNfBFnRvE0DTWBQ3_SKUs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=66XbeRLUxJI06vZ9r9CKxAn2gGU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=BTcGinEoENdPI-wVuB46eX8zUZc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=eNworJk5MTs-pEGFs39vHAgrHQ8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Facebook tries to warn users about Apple 'tax,' Apple says no","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ZnsD1MrNfBFnRvE0DTWBQ3_SKUs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=FvJ3vqVfDMx3iIxX-6pEaIxscho=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=TqU3PP3hmuIV8L7ZXkntS38B-as=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=BTcGinEoENdPI-wVuB46eX8zUZc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ZnsD1MrNfBFnRvE0DTWBQ3_SKUs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Facebook tries to warn users about Apple 'tax,' Apple says no","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It's on, now.

Rather than remove the tweet, Twitter will allow it to stand with some restrictions and a notice about how it violates the site's policies.\nWe placed a public interest notice on this Tweet for violating our Civic Integrity Policy for making misleading health claims that could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting. https://t.co/MA6E7mBpkm— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) August 23, 2020\n\nA follow-up tweet from Twitter Safety notes that the original tweet will be allowed to live on, just with limited engagements. That means no likes, no replies, and re-tweets without comment. It won't be deleted because most Trump tweets are considered relevant \"to ongoing public conversation\" by definition.\nSo now, anyone who looks at the newly flagged tweet will see a message sitting between it and the president's account info:\n\"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about civic and election integrity. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,\" the message reads, daring us not to laugh ruefully.\nWe're almost four years into this presidency and many have come to view Trump as a walking, talking, rage-filled manifestation of the \"old man yells at cloud\" meme. U.S. president or not, maybe it's time to re-think the old public interest rules. Eh, Twitter?\nThe company has taken an increasingly firm stance on Trump's social media behavior, which is to say multiple tweets emanating from the president's account have been flagged, but not removed, since May 2020. The latest flag marks the second time in recent months that Trump's dishonest portrayal of U.S. elections specifically has drawn Twitter's (again, incredibly mild) wrath."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=sCQOm-cdkFZbv5lxveWU9KG5Oxw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=B5-kT-gp7Vh9s74TPEcR-rTihlU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=V-iGyaX5wGpDciwdO5-0hV1BCMU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=5v6PWiVK4DSupjanxndf8xGbCEs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=f-K8qnAjeoW28Ou2SnXLFzZjSX8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118463%252Fdbab8b5c-6aeb-4bb2-8094-8cdb09e37235.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=XdprrFh1KUCitN9mJ9xYTsCNwYI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Hey look, it's a day ending in 'y'!

At the heart of the demo was a pig by the name of Gertrude, which he claimed has been linked up to some form of Neuralink for the past two months. \nRepeatedly emphasizing that the goal of the presentation was recruitment, Musk described the Neuralink device as \"a Fitbit in your skull, with tiny wires.\" Specifically, those tiny wires are one-twentieth the thickness of a hair, and 43 millimeters long. But it's possible to make them even longer to reach regions deeper in the brain, a Neuralink employee said.\nMusk predicted that Neuralinks, \"about the size of a large coin,\" would one day be implanted in humans in under an hour courtesy of a custom robot that is currently under development. He's talked about this before. \n\n\"I could have a Neuralink right now and you wouldn't know,\" Musk joked to the crowd. \"Maybe I do.\"\nThe idea, as Musk framed it, is to one day be able to \"solve\" a host of human ailments — memory loss, hearing loss, blindness, paralysis, depression, insomnia, extreme pain, seizures, anxiety, addiction, strokes, and brain damage — with the relatively tiny device. \n\"These can all be solved with an implantable Neuralink,\" Musk claimed. \n\nThe question, of course, is does any of this work? It's clearly early stages, but Musk demonstrated that the Neuralink in Gertrude \"connects to neurons that are in her snout,\" and showed a gathered crowd that when Gertrude sniffed and ate food, the computer received signals. The threads connecting the device to her brain are flexible, Musk said, so when she head-butts other pigs it can jostle around and still work.\n\nSo that's something, at least. It's also a step up from his USB-rat.\nAs Musk envisions it, in the future the Neuralink will connect to your phone via Bluetooth, and will charge wirelessly overnight. \nIn the Q&A segment that followed the presentation, a Neuralink employee stressed that privacy and security are on everyone's mind. All neural data would be encrypted, he stressed, and the company is already working with penetration testers to gird the device against hackers. \nMusk insisted that the team is \"working closely with the FDA,\" and that safety is their top priority.

A local self-described militia group had posted an event on Facebook urging its armed supporters to show up that same night. It may not be a coincidence.\nThe event was posted by the Facebook Page for the Kenosha Guard militia group. The group encouraged “armed citizens” to appear as a counter protest to those demonstrating over the police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n“Law enforcement is outnumbered and our Mayor has failed,” read the Facebook event information along with details on where and when to meet up. “Take up arms and let's defend our CITY!”\nThe Facebook event page has since been removed by the social network. \nWhite Supremecist counter protestors set to come to Kenosha in larger numbers today. I’m very worried about tonight. pic.twitter.com/cyuKC6qgv8— Sam Wunderle (@Sam_Wunderle) August 25, 2020\n\nProtests have erupted in Kenosha since Blake, an unarmed Black man, was shot seven times in the back on Sunday. Blake remains hospitalized, in stable condition.\nOne week ago, Facebook announced that it would crack down on pages and groups that encouraged “potential violence” as part of the company’s updated Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy. Facebook specifically mentioned militia groups in its update.\nKyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Illinois, was charged on Wednesday with first-degree murder. Following the shootings, numerous videos were shared on social media showing an armed Rittenhouse alongside other gun-toting counter-protesters claiming to be with local militia groups. Video footage also exists of Rittenhouse shooting at protesters.\nIt's unknown at this time if Rittenhouse or the group he attended the protests with saw the Kenosha Guard's Facebook event.\n\"We’ve designated this shooting as a mass murder and have removed the shooter’s accounts from Facebook and Instagram,\" a Facebook spokesperson said. \"At this time, we have not found evidence on Facebook that suggests the shooter followed the Kenosha Guard Page or that he was invited on the Event Page they organized.\"\nFacebook removed the page for the Kenosha Guard for violating that newly updated policy that now covers militia groups. The company is also designating the shooting as a violating event and will remove accounts and content depicting what transpired.\nThe Facebook of Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse, now charged with first degree murder for shooting two protesters, is wall-to-wall Blue Lives Matter/Thin Blue Line memes. pic.twitter.com/Uv0dIvYCOp— Arrivederci (@PapaGlider) August 26, 2020\n\nA Facebook account belonging to Rittenhouse shows an obsession with law enforcement and support for Blue Lives Matter. Rittenhouse’s Facebook page has also been taken down.\nInfoWars, the conspiratorial online outlet run by Alex Jones, also promoted the Facebook call to arms. The social media giant banned both Alex Jones and InfoWars from Facebook back in May 2019.\nThe shooting has been a topic of discussion within Boogaloo groups on Facebook. Boogaloo, also known as the Boogaloo Boys (or Bois), is a loosely-organized far-right militia movement that seeks to spark a second Civil War in the United States.\nRegardless of the alleged killer’s particular affiliation, he is being revered as a hero by the boogaloo bois – and memes identifying him as a king of their ideals are already circulating. pic.twitter.com/5xWsLV65xe— Tech Transparency Project (@TTP_updates) August 26, 2020\n\nThere has even been infighting within these groups as to whether Rittenhouse could be deemed Boogaloo as some say his pro-law enforcement stance runs counter to the movement. The Boogaloo movement does appear to be heralding his actions though. It’s unclear if Rittenhouse had any connection to Boogaloo groups. \nHowever, one thing is clear: Those Boogaloo groups shouldn’t even exist on Facebook to begin with. \nFacebook announced it was designating the Boogaloo movement as a “dangerous organization,” effectively banning them from the platform in June.\nUPDATE: Aug. 26, 2020, 8:16 p.m. EDT: The story has been updated to include Facebook's statement.   \nWATCH: Want to donate to help the Black Lives Matter movement?

Some people were fascinated. Others were annoyed and wary. Most, however, seemed excited to see the four-legged robot in person. \nThat's what I noticed from more than 4,500 miles away from home in Lima, Peru, while remotely operating the quadruped as it scurried along a busy sidewalk in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood.\n\nSEE ALSO: Oh, nothing, just Ford's robot dogs roaming the factory floor\nYou've probably seen Spot in viral videos of it pulling a truck or opening a door. Boston Dynamics made the 65-pound robot available to the public for about $75,000 in June. Now San Francisco-based robotics management company Formant has one of its own.\nI was able to see what pedestrians, shop workers, and fellow (well, sort of) dogs thought of the machine thanks to Formant's Spot dashboard, which I used to make it walk, sit, and back up. Its online portal works with other robotic systems as well.\nThe Bay Area walks were an idea Formant's CEO Jeff Linnell cooked up during the pandemic. This summer Formant started offering sign-ups for classroom \"field trips\" and individual walks to let anyone experience mainstream robotics through a Walk With Spot session. It's free for now to request a 30-minute Zoom call to communicate with Formant's human dog walker and push a few buttons on a home computer or gamepad to control Spot. \nWeird robot dog thing in Dolores Park right now pic.twitter.com/z2a4PBHgLj— paki tony soprano (tax payer) (@faiqus) August 20, 2020\n\n\"We're still at a place where walking down the street and seeing a robot dog is completely abnormal,\" Jeff Linnell, Formant's CEO, told me in a conversation before the walk. \nHe expects more robots to eventually interact with us on the street, in stores, and even at home, so to him, the walks are part of normalizing the inevitable. He braced me for a wide range of reactions from curiosity, suspicion, and cynicism to amusement, most of which I saw. No one angrily hit or spat on the robot, but Linnell said his team knows there's some resentment toward street bots. Previously, robots in the Bay Area have been kicked and defaced.\nThrough Formant's custom control panel, I was able to tell Spot to sit and strike a pose (downward dog is a classic) for photo ops. I made the bot back up when a package delivery worker rolled his cart out of a shop doorway. Most helpfully, I could see everything around Spot from the robot's 360-degree cameras. Every movement Spot took in the real world came from the trackpad or keypad arrows on my MacBook Air. \nIt's kind of scary how simple it was. I could hurl Spot forward at a top speed of 5 feet per second. Luckily, I had help. I could toggle to the perspective of the human wrangler, Dakota, who was alongside Spot, monitoring the situation on the ground and communicating with me through Zoom. \nHe could override the system at any point if something went wrong, even though the bot should be able to avoid collisions on its own. He warned me about sudden cars in intersections and nearby dogs coming from beyond camera range. \nDogs either freaked out at the sight of this headless monster, or carried on as if robot dogs have always been part of SF street life. Here's a curious pup who came to check out the situation during my session:\n\nHaving to coordinate with a human via Zoom made the process a little cumbersome. But overall it was easy to control Spot. \nFor the robotics industry, this is a turning point: You no longer need an entire engineering team to control a robot. You just need a few people comfortable with a laptop. \nEven I managed to keep Spot on course. I only sent it into a wall or pole a few times, with no lasting damage.\nCompanies can add on accessories, such as cameras, microphones, and LIDAR sensors, depending on the job they want Spot to do. Formant helps them keep track of all of that information, including camera footage and LIDAR maps.\n\"It's a DVR for robot data,\" he said. \n\nIt also offers live stats. At any moment you can get information about the robot's equipment, like its battery level or the status of its 12 motors. \n\"We're getting hundreds of signals from the robot all the time,\" Linnell explained. \nSEE ALSO: Oh, nothing, just Ford's robot dogs roaming the factory floor\nThe mechanical dog can walk up stairs or autonomously navigate around obstacles on a crowded sidewalk. Spot is already serving as a medical assistant for COVID-19 triage patients.

Among other details, it says that \"an elevated boardwalk and underwater passage connect the pavilion to the shore and The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,\" which sounds very cool. \n\nWhen night falls, the orb glows in a multitude of colors — check out some night shots here. \nSEE ALSO: Apple now gives customers a full year to buy AppleCare+\nThe Apple Marina Bay Sands store will be Apple's third store in Singapore, the other two are located at Orchard Road and Jewel Changi Airport.

Unfortunately, it can so easily suck time, leaving you stressed and under pressure to get all your other tasks done. \nWe are here to help. We don't want your email inbox to get you down so we've broken down eight great ways to organize your Gmail set-up to improve your productivity. \nGetting started \nMany of the changes we're suggesting need to be actioned in your Gmail's \"Settings\" area. \nTo access your settings in a browser, tap on the cog-shaped icon at the top right-hand corner of your screen. \n\nThis will bring up your quick settings menu to the right of your screen. Click on the \"Sell all settings\" box to bring up the full-fat Gmail settings menu. \nSet up a reading pane \nA reading pane gives you a way to read emails alongside your standard inbox view. Many people find this makes it faster to read and reply to messages. You can select to see a reading pane below your inbox or to the right of your inbox. \nTo make these changes to your Gmail, head to your settings, then select the \"Inbox\" tab along the top of your screen. Now scroll down to see the \"Enable reading pane\" option. Check this and select where you'd like the pane to appear.\n\nRather than choose to have a permanent pane, you can also select an option that allows you to toggle between a split pane mode and your standard inbox view. To activate this option, select the \"No split\" option. \n\nThis adds an icon to the top right of your inbox that allows you to switch between seeing a preview pane below your inbox, or have a standard full inbox view. \nEnable desktop notifications for Gmail\nIf you're waiting for an important email to come through, or you just don't want to miss a message from your boss, we recommend enabling Gmail's desktop notifications. This means you can work away in another browser tab and not have to keep obsessively checking your inbox to see if it has refreshed. \nYou can turn on Gmail desktop notifications by heading to your settings, then scrolling down the \"General\" options to see your \"Desktop notifications\" area. \n\nClick to turn \"New mail notifications on.\" Now, you'll see a pop-up notification in the bottom right-hand side of your browser screen when a new email is delivered. \nActivate the unread message icon \nAlternatively, if you're dead set against desktop notifications, but want to keep an eye on the status of your inbox whilst working in other tabs, there is another solution. \nGo to Gmail Settings, then under the \"Advanced\" settings in the \"General\" menu, scroll down to see your \"Unread message icon\" options. \n\nIf you enable this, your Gmail favicon will show how many unread messages you have waiting for you as a teeny tiny number. \nCreate a group email list \nThis is a handy tool to really save you some serious time if you often email the same group of people. There is a way to set up a list of email addresses into one group that you can customize the name of. \nTo do this, you need to go to Google Contacts. Look at the left-hand side of the screen to find the \"Labels\" menu. Click on \"Create label\" and give it a name that is easy to remember. \n\nNow you can drag and drop contacts into that label from the list on the right. \n\nNow, when you're composing an email, start typing the name of the label you've created in the \"To\" field and you'll see your label pop up as a suggestion. Simply click on it to add the entire group as a recipient. \nCreate useful templates in Gmail\nIf you often email the same message, then you can save a ton of time by turning that basic missive into a template. You can create up to 50 Gmail templates that you can insert into the body of an email with just a few clicks. \nFirst, you need to enable your Gmail account to allow template creation. Go to your settings, then under the \"General\" tab, click on \"Advanced.\" Click to enable. \n\nHead back to your inbox, open a new compose pop-up, and type exactly what you'd like the template's text to be. Once you've finished, click the three dots \"More\" menu at the bottom right of your compose window. Land on \"Templates,\" then select to \"Save draft as template.\" \n\nNow you just need to give the template an easily recognizable name. To use your template, open a new compose email pop-up, click the three dots menu and \"Templates\" again, and select the name of your template from the next menu screen that appears. \n\nMake the most of email labels \nLabels are Gmail's version of creating folders in your inbox. To create a new label you need to look to the left of your Gmail inbox and scroll down until you can click the \"More\" option. Scroll down again and you'll see the option to \"Create new label.\"\n\nIf you click this you can give your label a name. You can also choose to \"nest\" additional labels under a main label, creating sub-labels. \n\nThis is a useful way of really micro-managing your Gmail labels. \n\nYou can also change the color of your Gmail labels to give you a better at-a-glance way of organizing your messages. To change the color, hover over the label you want to edit, then click the three dots menu that appears. \n\nClick \"Label color\" to change it to one of the pre-loaded options.\nThe easiest way to move an email to a label is to drag and drop it where you want it. Alternatively, if you're in the email, you can click the label-shaped icon towards the top of the screen to chose the label you want from a pop-up list. \n\nActivate Gmail keyboard shortcuts \nIf you're someone that uses keyboard shortcuts, then you'll be delighted to hear that Gmail has a comprehensive suite of such actions. In order to start using them, you need to activate them. \nGo to your settings, then under \"General\" scroll down to turn keyboard shortcuts on.\n\nTo see a full list of shortcuts that you can now use, take a look at Google's handy guide to all the shortcuts that currently work in the email service. \n\nUse Auto-Advance to speed through your inbox\nIf you receive a high volume of email that can be dealt with quickly, activating auto-advance is a great way to speedily work through your new emails. \nThis feature will automatically show you the next conversation instead of taking you back to your main inbox view after you delete, archive, or mute a conversation. \nTo activate this, head to your settings, then the \"Advanced\" tab under \"General\", and toggle it on. \n\nUpping your Gmail game \nNot all these tweaks will suit every user, but we hope you've discovered a few useful Gmail tricks that will ease your email burden. \nSimply changing how you view your Gmail by adding a reading pane might be the refresh you need to up your productivity.

Depending on the result of the U.S. presidential election, it may give us one more. Either way, it's high time we questioned the impact of these high-tech data-driven calculations, which increasingly determine who or what we see (and what we don't) online. \nThe impact of algorithms is starting to scale up to a dizzying degree, and literally billions of people are feeling the ripple effects. This is the year the Social Credit System, an ominous Black Mirror-like \"behavior score\" run by the Chinese government, is set to officially launch. It may not be quite as bad as you've heard, but it will boost or tighten financial credit and other incentives for the entire population. There's another billion unexamined, unimpeachable algorithms hanging over a billion human lives.   \nIn the UK, few will forget this year's A-level algorithm. A-levels are key exams for 18-year olds; they make or break college offers. COVID-19 canceled them. Teachers were asked what each pupil would have scored. But the government fed these numbers into an algorithm alongside the school's past performance. Result: 40 percent of all teacher estimates were downgraded, which nixed college for high-achieving kids in disadvantaged areas. Boris Johnson backed down, eventually, blaming a \"mutant algorithm.\" Still, even a former colleague of the prime minister thinks the A-level fiasco may torpedo his reelection chances. \nIn the U.S., we don't tend to think about shadowy government algorithms running or ruining our lives. Well, not unless you're a defendant in one of the states where algorithms predict your likelihood of committing more crime (eat your heart out, Minority Report) and advise judges on sentencing. U.S. criminal justice algorithms, it probably won't surprise you to learn, are operated by for-profit companies and stand accused of perpetuating racism. Such as  COMPAS in Florida and Wisconsin, which ProPublica found was twice as likely to label Black defendants \"high risk\" than white defendants — and was wrong about 40 percent of the time. \nThe flaws in such \"mutant algorithms,\" of course, reflect their all-too-human designers. Math itself isn't racist, or classist, or authoritarian. An algorithm is just a set of instructions. Technically, the recipe book in your kitchen is full of them. As with any recipe, the quality of an algorithm depends on its ingredients — and those of us who have to eat the result really don't think enough about what went on in the kitchen. \n\"All around us, algorithms provide a kind of convenient source of authority, an easy way to delegate responsibility; a short cut that we take without thinking,\" writes mathematician Hannah Fry in her 2018 book Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms. \"Who is really going to click through to the second page of Google every time and think critically about every result?\"\nTry to live without algorithms entirely, however, and you'll soon notice their absence. Algorithms are often effective because they are able to calculate multiple probabilities faster and more effectively than any human mind. Anyone who's ever spent longer on the road because they thought they could outsmart Google Maps' directions knows the truth of this. This thought experiment imagining a day without algorithms ended in terrible gridlock, since even traffic-light systems use them. \nStill, you would be right to be concerned about the influence algorithms have on our internet lives — particularly in the area of online content. The more scientists study the matter, the more it seems that popular search, video and social media algorithms are governing our brains. Studies have shown they can alter our mood (Facebook itself proved that one) and yes, even our 2016 votes (which explains why the Trump campaign is investing so much into Facebook ads this time around). \nSo before we find out the full effect of algorithms in 2020 let's take a look at the algorithms on each of the major content services — many of which are surprisingly easy to erase from our lives. \n1. Facebook\nNo algorithm on Earth, not even China's Social Credit system, has the power of Mark Zuckerberg's. Every day, nearly 2 billion people visit Facebook. Nearly all of them allow the algorithm to present posts in the order that the company has determined most likely to keep them engaged. That means you see a lot more posts from friends you've engaged with in the past, regardless of how close you actually are to them. It also means content that causes big back-and-forth fights is pushed to the top. And Zuckerberg knows it. \n\"Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness,\" warned a 2018 internal Facebook study, unearthed by the Wall Street Journal. Left unchecked, these mutant algorithms would favor \"more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention & increase time on the platform.\" \nZuckerberg, reportedly afraid that conservatives would be disproportionately affected if he tweaked the algorithm to surface more harmonious posts, shelved the study. It's been a good four years for conservatives on Facebook, who have been playing the referee ever since they petitioned Zuckerberg to stop using human editors to curate news in 2016. Now look at Facebook's top performing posts in 2020; on a daily basis, the list is dominated by names such as Ben Shapiro, Franklin Graham, and Sean Hannity. \nBut even conservatives have cause to be disquieted by the Facebook algorithm. Seeing friends' popular posts has been shown to make us more depressed. Facebook addiction is heavily correlated with depressive disorder. So-called \"super sharers\" drown out less active users, according to the 2018 report; an executive who tried to reduce the super-sharer influence on the algorithm abruptly left the company.\nHow to fix it \n\nLuckily, you can reduce their influence yourself. Because Facebook still allows you to remove the sorting algorithm from your timeline, and simply view all posts from all your friends and follows in reverse chronological order (that is, most recently posted at the top). On Facebook.com, click the three dots next to \"News Feed,\" then click \"most recent.\" On the app, you'll need to click \"settings,\" then \"see more,\" then \"most recent.\"\nThe result? Well, you might be surprised to catch up with old friends you'd almost forgotten about. And if you interact with their posts, you're training the content algorithm for when you go back to your regular timeline. In my experience, reverse chronological order isn't the most thrilling way to browse Facebook — the algorithm knows what it's doing, locking your brain in with the most exciting posts — but it's a nice corrective. If you're one of the two billion on Facebook every day, try this version at least once a week. \n2. YouTube\nThe YouTube \"watch next\" algorithm may be even more damaging to democracy than Facebook's preference for controversial posts. Some 70 percent of YouTube videos we consume were recommended by the service's algorithm, which is optimized to make you watch more YouTube videos and ads no matter what (the average viewing session is now above one hour). \nThat means YouTube prioritizes controversial content, because whether you love it or hate it, you'll keep watching. And once you've watched one piece of controversial content, the algorithm will assume that's what you're into, steering you to the kind of stuff viewers of that video opted to watch next. Which explains how your grandparents can start by watching one relatively innocuous Fox News video and end up going down a QAnon conspiracy theory rabbit hole. \nA former Google programmer, Guillaime Chaslot, found the YouTube algorithm may have been biased enough to swing the outcome of the 2016 election, which was decided by 77,000 votes in three states. \"More than 80 percent of recommended videos were favorable to Trump, whether the initial query was 'Trump' or 'Clinton',\" he wrote in the immediate aftermath. \"A large proportion of these recommendations were divisive and fake news.\" Similarly, Chaslot found that 90 percent of videos recommended from the search query \"is the Earth flat?\" said that yes, indeed it is. \nThis isn't just a problem in the U.S. One of the most important case studies of the YouTube algorithm's political impact was in Brazil, where fringe right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro was elected president after unexpectedly becoming a YouTube star. \"YouTube’s search and recommendation system appears to have systematically diverted users to far-right and conspiracy channels in Brazil,\" a 2019 New York Times investigation found. Even Bolsonaro's allies credited YouTube for his win. \nHow to fix it\n\nTurning off autoplay, an option next to the \"Up Next\"  list, will at least stop you from blindly watching whatever the YouTube algorithm recommends. You can't turn off recommendations altogether, but you can at least warn less tech-savvy relatives that the algorithm is doing its level best to radicalize them in service of views. \nChaslot's nonprofit algotransparency.org will show you what videos are most recommended across the site on any given day. By now, you may not be surprised to see that Fox News content tends to float to the top. Your YouTube recommendation algorithm may look normal to you if it's had years to learn your likes and dislikes. But a brand-new user will see something else entirely.  \n3. Instagram\nWhile parent company Facebook allows you to view your feed in reverse chronological order, Instagram banished that option altogether back in 2016 — leading to a variety of conspiracy theories about \"shadow banning.\" It will still show you every photo and story if you keep scrolling for long enough, but certain names float to the top so frequently that you'd be forgiven for feeling like a stalker. (Hello, Instagram crushes!) \nHow to fix it\n\nAs of a February update, Instagram will at least let you see who you've been inadvertently ignoring. Click on your profile icon in the bottom right corner, click on your \"following\" number, and you'll see two categories: \"Least Interacted With\" and \"Most Shown In Feed.\" Click on the former, scroll through the list, and give your most ignored follows some love. \nSEE ALSO: How tech companies can turn 'commitments' to diversity into action\nYou can also sort your feed by the order in which you followed accounts, which is truly infuriating. Why offer that option, and not just give us a straight-up chronological feed? Instagram is also said to be testing a \"Latest posts\" feature that will catch you up on recent happenings, but this hasn't rolled out to all users yet. \n4. Twitter\nJust like its social media rivals, Twitter is obsessed with figuring out how it can present information in anything other than most recent order — the format that Twitter has long been known for. Founder Jack Dorsey has introduced solutions that will allow you to follow topics, not just people, and to show you tweets in your timeline that drove the most engagement first. \nHow to fix it\n\nAll of these non-chronological tweaks fall under the \"Home\" heading at the top of the page. Click the star icons next to it, and you'll have the opportunity to go back to traditional Twitter-style \"Latest Tweets.\" Of all the social media services, Twitter is the one that makes it easiest to ignore its recommendation algorithm. \nIt may take a little more scrolling to find the good stuff on Latest Tweets, and of course what you're seeing depends on what time of day you're dipping into the timeline. Still, Latest Tweets is your best bet for a range of opinions and information from your follows unimpeded by any mutant algorithms.  "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472420%252F538c8ef8-681e-4c86-b32f-2cc47469a121.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=2vVd3-k2XGvOpobWClYtaAjY_Ws=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=s9I1yeflcOCfDDOE6qCSeK6UlAU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F356x205.png?signature=RcDXqljTGEhm9euThdkEZYlGrYM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F712x410.png?signature=CM_sbMznKqvn1S-3YsMG16SspwY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F280x157.png?signature=I0XInR97T-DCpfVMz45x4Js1Blc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118536%252F62f3daf0-b8f8-4007-802c-ac557b78008f.png%252F560x314.png?signature=cwFPDGPmhEX_Qgr_b0an5Rp3S4A=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Algorithms control your online life.

It’s mysterious, it’s all-knowing, it’s omnipotent. Except that it’s not. \nAn algorithm is a simple concept that, today, has many complex manifestations. Algorithms’ central and opaque position at the heart of social networks like Facebook cause some to view algorithms in general with a sort of mystical reverence. Algorithms have become synonymous with something highly technical and difficult to understand, that is either an arbiter of objective truth, or, on the other end of the spectrum, something wholly untrustworthy.\nBut when people refer to “the algorithm” — whether Facebook's or another tech company’s recommendation algorithm, or just “algorithms” in general — do they really know what it means? Judging by how widely the term is used and misused, most likely not. As Mashable embarks on our exploration of algorithms, we wanted to get something straight right off the bat: What is an algorithm, anyway?\nMashable spoke with Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor at the University of Washington who has also written a book about the ever-growing role algorithms play in our lives. Before you go being alternatively impressed by or distrusting of the next computer algorithm you encounter, get back to basics on the concept that’s powering our world. \n1. An algorithm is a set of very specific instructions\nHow to bake a cake, find the sum of two plus two, or even run a country according to the U.S. Constitution are all examples of algorithms. Why? Because, according to Domingos, the definition of an algorithm is “a sequence of instructions.” That’s it! \nToday, an algorithm usually refers to “a sequence of instructions that tells a computer what to do.” A computer program is an algorithm, written in a computer programming language, that a computer can understand and execute. \nAlgorithms written for computers also have to be extremely precise, often using the instructions “if,” “then,” and “else.” For example, a self-driving car might run on an algorithm for navigating that says “IF the directions say turn left, THEN turn left.” See how specific you have to be to make a computer follow a seemingly simple set of instructions?\nIn the popular imagination, recommendation algorithms have come to dominate our idea of what an algorithm is. That is, when many people think about or refer to algorithms, they’re referencing something like what TV show Netflix thinks you might like, or which international travelers belong on the no-fly list. While these are extremely complicated algorithms, at their hearts, they’re still just a set of instructions a computer follows to complete a specified task. \n“With computers, the algorithm can get vastly more complex,” Domingos said. “Addition is an algorithm that's defined in a few lines of text. Computers can have algorithms that take millions of lines to define.”\n2. People wrote and used algorithms long before computers even existed\nAs early as the Babylonian era, humans were writing algorithms to help them do the mathematical equations that allowed them to manage their agricultural society. \n“There were algorithms before computers, because you don't need a computer to execute an algorithm, the algorithm can be executed by a person,” Domingos said.\nAlgorithms using computers first rose to prominence in the mid-20th century, when the military began writing formulas for, say, determining where to aim a missile at a moving object. The concept then moved into business administration, with computers running formulas for administering payroll and such, and in science, for tracking the movements in the sky. \nA turning point for modern algorithms came when Larry Page and Sergei Brin wrote the Google PageRank algorithm. Instead of just relying on information within a page to determine how relevant it was to a search term, the search engine algorithm incorporated a host of other signals that would help it surface the best results. Most notably, how many other links pointed to the article, and how reputable those articles were, based on how many links pointed to those pages, and so on. That was a powerful sign of relevance. And the rest is history. \n3. Today, you can find algorithms everywhere\nWhile we might think of algorithms as mathematical equations, algorithms, according to Domingos, “can compute anything from anything, there might be no numbers involved at all.” One prominent and extremely complex algorithm is the algorithm that governs the Facebook News Feed. It’s an equation that Facebook uses to determine what pieces of content to show its users as they scroll; in other words, a set of instructions to decide what goes on the News Feed.\n“There's no end of things that Facebook could put on your News Feed but it has to choose.”\n“There's no end of things that Facebook could put on your News Feed but it has to choose,” Domingos said. “And it's usually a combination of things like how much do you care about the people that produced directly or indirectly that post? How close are they to you in your social network, how relevant it is in its own terms because of the subject, and also how recent.”\nFacebook, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies all rely on algorithms to serve content and products to their customers. But there are also algorithms throughout your life that you might not be aware of. \nFor example, Domingos explained that an algorithm governs how your dishwasher knows when it’s time to transition from washing to drying, or how your car regulates fuel intake and knows when its tank is full while at the gas station, or how shadows appear in a digitally animated movie to perfectly replicate the sun in the real world.\n“Clearly, every time you interact with the computer, or you're on the internet, there's algorithms involved,” Domingos said. “But these days algorithms are also involved in just about everything.”\n4. The most complex algorithms use machine learning\nAs we learned, an algorithm typically has to be written in “excruciating detail” for a computer to understand what to do. However, that’s not the case when the people who write algorithms incorporate machine learning — a type of artificial intelligence — which leads to the most sophisticated algorithms.\n“In traditional programming, a human being has to write down every little detail of what the other has to do, and that is very time consuming, very costly,” Domingos said. “Machine learning is the computer discovering its own algorithms instead of being told what to do.”\nPut another way, machine learning is when a programmer feeds a program some raw data as a starting point, then submits the end point of what an organized, classified version of that data looks like, and leaves it up to the program to figure out how to get from point A to point B. Consider an onion: A human who knows how to cook can turn that onion from a pungent raw sphere into strips of caramelized goodness. In a traditional algorithm, a programmer would write every single step of the cooking instructions. But in an algorithm developed by artificial intelligence, given the end point as a goal, the program would figure out how to get from raw to caramelized itself. Hence, the machine learned. \nThese types of algorithms become even more powerful when a human being wouldn’t know how to get from point A to point B. For example, a human process like being able to recognize that a cat is a cat takes so much complicated brain power that it would be impossible to write out step by step. But by giving a program a bunch of images of a cat, and images that are not a cat, and showing the desired endpoint as categorizing a cat image as a cat, the computer can learn to execute that process itself.\n“It's the computer learning to program itself instead of having to be programmed by people.\"\n“It's the computer learning to program itself instead of having to be programmed by people,” Domingos said. “This, of course, is extraordinarily powerful when it works, because now you can, you know, create very powerful, very complex algorithms with very little human intervention.” It's also very funny when it doesn't work.\n5. Despite the term’s recent cache, algorithms aren’t magic\nThanks to the sheer amount of data algorithms process, it might seem like they’re all-knowing mystery boxes built to reveal secrets. However, remember that an algorithm just means a set of instructions. What’s more, humans create algorithms, which means they can be flawed.\n“There's also a lot of misconceptions about algorithms, partly because people don't really see what's going on inside the computer,” Domingos said. “A very common one is that people think that algorithms are somehow perfect.”\nDomingos explained that programmers spend enormous amounts of time fixing mistakes in algorithms so that the lines of code produce the appropriate results. However, humans don’t always catch those mistakes. What’s more, an algorithm is based around the output a human wants to see, or what that human is optimizing for. Take a hiring algorithm, which ostensibly should find the best candidate for a job. If a human sets the instructions to look at qualifications that aren’t necessarily relevant to a job (say, university pedigree), just because the algorithm then says “candidate A is the best person,” doesn’t make it the truth.\nOften, that’s because of bias. And problems with bias can get even worse with algorithms that utilize artificial intelligence.\n“In traditional programming you have to worry about the biases of the programmer,” Domingos said. “In machine learning, mainly, you have to worry about the biases that come from the data.”\nFor example, a hiring algorithm powered by machine learning might use as its starting point a bunch of resumes of candidates, and as its output the resumes of people who were hired in the past. However, most tech companies are not racially diverse. So an automated algorithm that makes hiring recommendations could mirror that real world inequality.\nStudies have shown that artificial intelligence can mirror the gender and race stereotypes of the humans that train them. In one study, an algorithm that produced word associations used the entirety of the English language on the web as its training data to learn associations between words. Thanks to the biases that exist in our world, the algorithm determined that female names were more associated with the arts, while male names were more associated with math and science. Studies like these show that algorithms are not inherently neutral, perfect, or malevolent: They simply do what the humans and data that train them say to do. In short, they’re just as flawed as we are.\n6. Algorithms are ushering in a technological revolution\nAlgorithms may be imperfect, but they are nonetheless transforming our world. \n“All these things that we take for granted like the web and social media, and on and on, they wouldn't exist without algorithms,” Domingos said.\n“Algorithms are doing for mental work what the Industrial Revolution did for manual work.” \nAs these automated sets of instructions become more and more widespread — from your dishwasher to the government’s supercomputers — humans have the ability to exercise our knowledge more quickly and efficiently than ever before. Domingos views that as nothing short of revolutionary.\n“Algorithms are doing for mental work what the Industrial Revolution did for manual work,” Domingos said. “Algorithms are the automation of intelligence. And if you think about that, this is a very powerful thing: to do something that used to take, you know, human thinking and labor to do, now can be done by an algorithm.”\nAlgorithms are here to stay. But how we design them — biased or equitable, helpful or harmful — and how much we unquestionably accept their presence, is up to us.\nRead more from Algorithms:\n\n  Algorithms control your online life.

'em.\nThat appears to the thinking of Triller, a U.S.-based \"social streaming\" app, which according to Bloomberg teamed up with an asset management firm in an attempt to buy TikTok for $20 billion. Or, more specifically, to buy parts of TikTok for $20 billion. \nThose parts include TikTok's U.S., Australian, New Zealand, and Indian components — locations where the ByteDance-owned company ran into various legal troubles, faced security concerns, and risks possible shuttering. India went so far as to ban TikTok outright in June for \"[engaging] in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.\" \nTriller, perhaps smelling blood in the water, joins the ever-growing list of U.S. companies trying to get a piece of TikTok's huge social media market share. As of the time of this writing, Microsoft, Twitter, Oracle, and Walmart have all reportedly expressed interest in buying TikTok's U.S. assets. \nIn August, TikTok revealed that it has approximately 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.\nWe reached out to TikTok, Triller, and the asset management fund in question, Centricus, both in an effort to confirm Bloomberg's reporting and to learn if TikTok had responded to an offer. Neither Triller nor Centricus responded, and a TikTok spokesperson merely pointed us to previous news coverage. \nA Centricus spokesperson reportedly confirmed to Bloomberg that the company had made an offer. A Reuters report from Friday claims TikTok denies knowledge of any offer. \nBloomberg was able to wrangle a more interesting comment from a TikTok spokesperson, however, who suggested the entire thing wasn't even worth the company's time. \nSEE ALSO: TikTok wants to 'eliminate hate' on its platform. Good luck with that.\n\"What's Triller?\" the spokesperson reportedly replied. \nSuch a response suggests that if Triller does end up buying TikTok's U.S. assets, it won't be because TikTok viewed the deal as a match made in digital heaven."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=ke80B0Ci4i9IV92HbMU8QZi35RE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=-2_IEAU4q4LUYO4WkJZa1VcysGM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ONY7uWDcdX6WnPvhl9zia9b32jI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F712x410.png?signature=S-wM7WMevXdSJyLLyBMbvRmuaGM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F280x157.png?signature=62BsHwlFQHRZBpSfzGgIC__XkXg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F560x314.png?signature=3vUegtWuorETS32SkCmG33UhUrc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"And now Triller is trying to buy U.S. TikTok, report claims","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ONY7uWDcdX6WnPvhl9zia9b32jI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=ABlfkr9mM8wk19hbMSars6zn1mU=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=CTKI-tBUFOvYRtgrF50NSnCT-w8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F280x157.png?signature=62BsHwlFQHRZBpSfzGgIC__XkXg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118713%252F1f8c1363-ebb9-499d-a7ee-1e606fd02485.png%252F356x205.png?signature=ONY7uWDcdX6WnPvhl9zia9b32jI=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"And now Triller is trying to buy U.S. TikTok, report claims","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Triller joins an ever-growing list of companies trying to get a piece of that TikTok pie.

Notably, The Verge reports that the event page issued a \"call to arms\" — not in response to Wisconsin police shooting Jacob Blake seven times in the back, but rather the protests demanding justice for the shooting. \n\n\"The page violated our policies, and there have been a bunch of media reports asking, you know, why this page and event weren't removed sooner, especially when in this case a bunch of people did report the page,\" said Zuckerberg. \"And, the reason for this, it was largely an operational mistake.\"\nThat's right. According to Zuckerberg, the reason Facebook chose to tacitly approve an event page that, by his own admission, violated the site's own rules, is because the non-Facebook employees tasked with enforcing his company's Byzantine policies didn't understand them well enough. \nAfter the Kenosha Guard's \"call to arms,\" a white teenager, whose Facebook page depicted an obsession with police, Donald Trump, and guns, allegedly shot and killed two protesters, and injured a third.\nIn his Friday speech, Zuckerberg was quick to point out that Facebook has yet to definitively prove that shooter had seen the Kenosha Guard event page.  \n\"At this point we haven't yet found any evidence that the shooter was following this Kenosha Guard page, or was connected to the event or invited to the event in any way,\" insisted the CEO.\nAs for the Kenosha Guard event page, Zuckerberg really wants you to know that the \"call to arms\" was beyond the comprehension of his contractors. \nSEE ALSO: A militia group posted a 'call to arms' on Facebook. Now two people in Kenosha are dead.\n\"The team that enforces our policy against dangerous organizations is a specialized team, you know, that is trained to look for symbolism and innuendo and different things that require a significant amount of training in some of these cases to understand the details or the nuances of how certain militias or certain conspiracy networks or other dangerous organizations operate,\" the CEO rambled. \"And the contractors and the reviewers who the initial complaints were funneled to didn't basically didn't pick this up.\"\nWhat a reassuring statement of accountability from one of the richest and most powerful people in the world. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=rAwIUU1g4DlKjMyOC5043kZsByg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=L0SLGUI1K7PHo-4Z5mX8FmFYqHA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F356x205.png?signature=YiGgz7JgLg-c8LUGcXSfz78AA88=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F712x410.png?signature=oKMNl9129cnNv6Lz9S_ckP-UjUY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F280x157.png?signature=gLPtQse-je3WY6omVnYJNfh_GlY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F560x314.png?signature=QC_mRoy89nEYo7U3eAFqAweUvAU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Mark Zuckerberg blames Facebook contractors for Kenosha militia fiasco","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F356x205.png?signature=YiGgz7JgLg-c8LUGcXSfz78AA88=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F280x157.png?signature=gLPtQse-je3WY6omVnYJNfh_GlY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118711%252F29692ebc-4e4a-4e7c-8634-ad861859c994.png%252F356x205.png?signature=YiGgz7JgLg-c8LUGcXSfz78AA88=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"Mark Zuckerberg blames Facebook contractors for Kenosha militia fiasco","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Facebook failed to remove a militia group's \"call to arms\" ahead of a deadly shooting in Wisconsin, despite hundreds of warnings.

Whether you’re sick of your binge watching sessions being interrupted with infinite buffering, or your colleagues keep calling you out for your poor Zoom connection (nobody wants screenshots of your face frozen on screen, least of all you), a WiFi booster is one of the easiest and most affordable ways to improve your internet connection without forking over a ton of cash on more premium priced solutions.\nWhat makes investing in a WiFi booster a great solution for most people is just how easy they are to install and immediately put to work. All you need is an existing router and an available wall outlet and you’re in business. The best part? Many people have great success with a WiFi booster alone, even when paired with an older router that doesn’t have the best signal or coverage.\nWhat is the difference between WiFi booster and WiFi extender?\nA WiFi extender works by pulling signals from your router before relaying it to your devices — thus allowing you to use your WiFi more effectively from every corner of your home. In doing so, your home will be split into two different networks — the original router and the extension. This can be an issue for most folks who are looking to make connecting to the internet as seamless as possible.\nWiFi boosters, on the other hand, take a weak or poor reception and amplify the signals in order to experience a stronger overall connection. While doing so, they also extend the coverage without splicing the networks, which makes for a much easier overall user experience.\nThink about it like this: if you have a WiFi booster, you can easily add on a WiFi extender if you still need the extra coverage, but a WiFi extender likely won’t work very well without a booster (unless you already have an incredibly strong WiFi signal as it is).\nDo WiFi boosters really work?\nWiFi boosters really do work—if you have the right booster for your specific lifestyle or household needs. Essentially, a WiFi booster extends your existing network coverage by boosting your signals. It actually pulls your existing WiFi from your transmitter or router, amplifies the signals and broadcasts the WiFi throughout your home, extending its reach and strength to multiple floors and even outdoors.\nWhat is the best WiFi booster?\nWhile there are a lot of great WiFi boosters on the market at a variety of affordable prices, if you’re looking for a real workhorse that will ensure you never run into endless buffering or video chat issues again, look no further than the TP-Link AC2600. This premium piece of tech checks off all the right boxes when it comes to a great WiFi booster: it’s compact, easy to install, and promises to boost your signal up to 2600 Megabits per second (Mbps). \nThat said, depending on your budget and lifestyle, we’ve pulled together some of the absolute best WiFi boosters to accommodate all types of internet users. Whether you’re looking for something compact that will boost the signal in your apartment for streaming your shows, or you need a serious workhorse that will ensure you and your roommates or family members can take your respective Zoom meetings without worrying about having an adequate connection, these are the most reliable boosters on the market."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118556%252F9a8e5597-3f51-4e41-913a-97bdc856e68f.jpeg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpeg?signature=bXpbWdx2aYT99VpU72YTgEvX6jo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118556%252F9a8e5597-3f51-4e41-913a-97bdc856e68f.jpeg%252F1438x0.jpeg?signature=h0vikE6perjhxberfjGtCnzqY48=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118556%252F9a8e5597-3f51-4e41-913a-97bdc856e68f.jpeg%252F356x205.jpeg?signature=xDNFer3zRD6Aa_oPSOB9RLzmwFs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118556%252F9a8e5597-3f51-4e41-913a-97bdc856e68f.jpeg%252F712x410.jpeg?signature=EX8-cr0zcruml-zk4NDfgD6xPLU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118556%252F9a8e5597-3f51-4e41-913a-97bdc856e68f.jpeg%252F280x157.jpeg?signature=cRg-3XILxytpfo7tO_cQvQuuBpo=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118556%252F9a8e5597-3f51-4e41-913a-97bdc856e68f.jpeg%252F560x314.jpeg?signature=PYlyRVeBBqiIZWxgsrQbNJNu84o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Does your WiFi suck lately?

At the heart of the demo was a pig by the name of Gertrude, which he claimed has been linked up to some form of Neuralink for the past two months. \nRepeatedly emphasizing that the goal of the presentation was recruitment, Musk described the Neuralink device as \"a Fitbit in your skull, with tiny wires.\" Specifically, those tiny wires are one-twentieth the thickness of a hair, and 43 millimeters long. But it's possible to make them even longer to reach regions deeper in the brain, a Neuralink employee said.\nMusk predicted that Neuralinks, \"about the size of a large coin,\" would one day be implanted in humans in under an hour courtesy of a custom robot that is currently under development. He's talked about this before. \n\n\"I could have a Neuralink right now and you wouldn't know,\" Musk joked to the crowd. \"Maybe I do.\"\nThe idea, as Musk framed it, is to one day be able to \"solve\" a host of human ailments — memory loss, hearing loss, blindness, paralysis, depression, insomnia, extreme pain, seizures, anxiety, addiction, strokes, and brain damage — with the relatively tiny device. \n\"These can all be solved with an implantable Neuralink,\" Musk claimed. \n\nThe question, of course, is does any of this work? It's clearly early stages, but Musk demonstrated that the Neuralink in Gertrude \"connects to neurons that are in her snout,\" and showed a gathered crowd that when Gertrude sniffed and ate food, the computer received signals. The threads connecting the device to her brain are flexible, Musk said, so when she head-butts other pigs it can jostle around and still work.\n\nSo that's something, at least. It's also a step up from his USB-rat.\nAs Musk envisions it, in the future the Neuralink will connect to your phone via Bluetooth, and will charge wirelessly overnight. \nIn the Q&A segment that followed the presentation, a Neuralink employee stressed that privacy and security are on everyone's mind. All neural data would be encrypted, he stressed, and the company is already working with penetration testers to gird the device against hackers. \nMusk insisted that the team is \"working closely with the FDA,\" and that safety is their top priority. Oh yeah, and did he mention they're hiring?\nSEE ALSO: Elon Musk claims robot surgeon will sew electrodes into human brains in 2020\n\"If you've, like, shipped a smartwatch or a phone, or any kind of complex electronics or complex device, or advanced medical devices, we'd love for you to contact us and consider working here,\" Musk said toward the end of his presentation. \"So, a very important point to emphasize is that you do not need to have prior experience on brains.\"\nThe future is a weird place."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472455%252F22e745cc-4f0d-46ba-8651-175c0ecd89a6.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=ED0_7_Kfr6-Y_f4qihWRBcIlZWc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118703%252Fee6ee474-9d89-4533-a67e-e50cab4d9f60.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=3cFqpv38z5YgD7puDBsfFM1rC5c=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118703%252Fee6ee474-9d89-4533-a67e-e50cab4d9f60.png%252F356x205.png?signature=_nzhl0Jh-ddHd350C2p7GvQRgsQ=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118703%252Fee6ee474-9d89-4533-a67e-e50cab4d9f60.png%252F712x410.png?signature=DDrxmGwkzII3saLS4B4d4tCHgtw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

tried to inform its users that Apple is taking a 30 percent cut on Facebook's online events app, but Apple rejected the update, Reuters reported Friday. \nIn fact, Apple said no to Facebook twice. \nFirst, the social network asked Apple to waive its 30 percent fee, which it charges on in-app purchases, on Facebook's upcoming tool that would let users host paid online events. The idea behind the request was to offset losses incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, so Facebook wanted to pass on all revenue to users, but Apple declined.  \nThen, Facebook planned to launch the app with a notice saying that Apple has declined to waive its Apple Tax, as the 30 percent fee is sometimes called. However, Apple said no to that as well, citing an App Store rule that prohibits sharing \"irrelevant\" information with users. \n\"Don’t include irrelevant information, including but not limited to information about Apple or the development process,\" Apple's App Store guidelines say. \nA few weeks ago, Facebook released an image showing what this notice would look like. The iOS variant (on the left) says \"Apple takes 30 percent of this purchase,\" while the notice on Android (right) says that \"Facebook doesn't take a fee from this purchase.\" \nNotably, according to Reuters, the Android version doesn't display the notice, either. \n\nFacebook isn't giving up, though. \n\"Now more than ever, we should have the option to help people understand where money they intend for small businesses actually goes. Unfortunately Apple rejected our transparency notice around their 30 percent tax but we are still working to make that information available inside the app experience,\" Facebook told Reuters. \nSEE ALSO: Microsoft backs Epic Games, says Apple is threatening game development\nEarlier this month, the two companies had another public clash, as Facebook was forced to launch its Gaming app on iOS without games. Apple's stance was that the app breaks an App Store rule about apps whose main purpose is distributing games (only Apple is allowed to have such an app). Facebook responded by mocking Apple in its Android app, and calling out the company for \"hurting players and developers.\"\nApple's App Store guidelines and rules have been under increased scrutiny in the past weeks, with Apple removing popular game Fortnite from the App Store for bypassing the 30 percent cut with in-game currency, and Fortnite's publisher Epic Games answering with a lawsuit. \n\"Apple's removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100 percent monopoly over the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market,\" reads a legal complaint by Epic Games. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1472018%252F25a27ca7-7333-42c3-8361-29684aadbef6.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=QnVqtBCMHYhV6S43CbPlnWIxnAY=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=xuhJQvEUeB7rKAG61HgU3XLTDrU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ZnsD1MrNfBFnRvE0DTWBQ3_SKUs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=66XbeRLUxJI06vZ9r9CKxAn2gGU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=BTcGinEoENdPI-wVuB46eX8zUZc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=eNworJk5MTs-pEGFs39vHAgrHQ8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Facebook tries to warn users about Apple 'tax,' Apple says no","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ZnsD1MrNfBFnRvE0DTWBQ3_SKUs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=FvJ3vqVfDMx3iIxX-6pEaIxscho=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=TqU3PP3hmuIV8L7ZXkntS38B-as=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=BTcGinEoENdPI-wVuB46eX8zUZc=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118659%252F2586680c-e530-457b-ba49-0cdf3827748d.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=ZnsD1MrNfBFnRvE0DTWBQ3_SKUs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Facebook tries to warn users about Apple 'tax,' Apple says no","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"It's on, now.

And why even bother with social engineering, when you can just buy the access you want?\nThat appears to be the thinking of a least one Russian man, who the FBI arrested and who has been charged with attempting to pay a Tesla Gigafactory employee in Nevada to instal malware on the company's network.\nThe Department of Justice announced the arrest on Tuesday, and Electrek reported Thursday that the company in question was indeed Tesla. \n\"This was a serious attack,\" wrote Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\nMuch appreciated. This was a serious attack.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 27, 2020\n\nWe reached out to Tesla to confirm Electrek's reporting, but received no immediate response. Even so, the official complaint against 27-year-old Egor Igorevich Kriuchkov presents a detailed look into a modern day criminal effort to extort a global company. \nAccording to the complaint, Kriuchkov allegedly traveled to Sparks, Nevada, the location of Tesla's Gigafactory, and rented a hotel room. While there, in early August, he met with an unnamed employee of \"Company A\" and proposed a \"special project.\"\nKriuchkov, the complaint alleges, was going to give the employee malware. The employee would then install it on the company's computers. In an effort to distract the company's security teams, Kriuchkov and his unnamed co-conspirators would run a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against the company (which, again, Electrek confirmed is Tesla) while this was all going down. Next, the malware would steal a bunch of info from the company's computers and send it to Kriuchkov's co-conspirators, who would then be able to extort the company for millions. \nTo sweeten the deal, the DOJ says Kriuchkov offered to pay the employee $1 million — in either cash or bitcoin — suggesting the size of the payout Kriuchkov hoped to get from Tesla was substantial. \nPretty simple, right? Well, except for the fact that the unnamed employee wanted nothing to do with it, and at some point started working with the FBI. The criminal complaint details various conversations that the employee had with Kriuchkov, and notes that they were \"consensually recorded\" — suggesting  that the employee wore a wire.\nSEE ALSO: Coronavirus 'exposure' soars at Tesla's Fremont plant, leak shows\nKriuchkov has been charged with conspiracy to intentionally cause damage to a protected computer, and faces the possibility of five years in prison plus a $250,000 fine. \nThe unnamed Tesla employee, presumably, still has a job. \nUPDATE: Aug. 27, 2020, 4:44 p.m. PDT: This story has been updated to include comment from Elon Musk."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1470493%252Fe6017c11-04c9-45a4-8e0b-180a354871d3.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=_fDn3JHGw692WgTYnfBUhkTzToA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=7uFQCcyNvs9idMilgfZnPa4TimU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=E8L6zpEKr1reSuEuv39aQaYrVVk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=pSFiIvBoLik2epO33pK04VgzWXg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=57qUhepN-67SZD3Nvut96yl3m8k=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=tcjmri9SSDMyh3y7e96YWdSq4Jg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Russian hacker tried to bribe a Tesla factory worker to install malware","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=E8L6zpEKr1reSuEuv39aQaYrVVk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=rMM-a4AIDQ3L__QVoNfc4TMHhV0=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=Zo5Xz4GJBtfv66K_AJNlmgVcUlA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=57qUhepN-67SZD3Nvut96yl3m8k=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118645%252F7bcfd68b-f73a-4ea3-95af-367c439f20c5.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=E8L6zpEKr1reSuEuv39aQaYrVVk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Russian hacker tried to bribe a Tesla factory worker to install malware","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The plan was to steal a bunch of info and extort the company for millions, the FBI claims.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Russian hacker tried to bribe a Tesla factory worker to install malware"},{"_id":"5f47e025bb19d4005600001f","id":"/article/walmart-tiktok-buy-microsoft-bid/","title":"Walmart might buy TikTok.

The report says Walmart plans on teaming up with Microsoft for the bid.\nNews of Walmart’s interest follows a report from earlier on Thursday that says TikTok is close to a sale valued between $20 billion to $30 billion. The price would include the company’s operations in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n“We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators,” said a Walmart spokesperson, confirming the company’s interest in an acquisition, to CNBC.\nEarlier this morning, TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer resigned from the company a mere four months into his stint. The former Disney executive cited the political pressure from the Trump administration as his reason for leaving TikTok.\nThe U.S. government has pressured TikTok for months over the company’s ties to its China-based parent company, ByteDance. On August 6, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that gave the video app an ultimatum: cut those Chinese ties or be banned in the United States. The Trump administration cited cybersecurity concerns related to the Chinese government’s access to the app’s data for its stance. However, just this week, TikTok filed a lawsuit against the administration, claiming their decision is politically based.\nMicrosoft has previously expressed interest in acquiring TikTok.

How much pleasure? Let's just say that I've scribbled my way through 21 pages so far, in under a day, just for the heck of it. If this prolific sensation isn't hypergraphia, a curious condition where you can't stop writing, it is at least somewhere in the same neurological neighborhood. \nThe device in question is the $399 Remarkable 2, a long-anticipated sequel to the world's first e-ink tablet. If you've encountered an e-ink screen before, it was probably on the Amazon Kindle. They are monochrome and much easier on the eye than a bright LED screen. You can use them in direct sunlight. E-ink is the closest thing the tech world has given us to regular pen on paper. \nThe first ReMarkable tablet, which launched in 2017 for $599, was widely praised for this paperlike quality. Yet it also came with a handful of flaws baked in. Its stylus (known as a \"marker\") was a little on the slow side, with a perceptible 40-millisecond delay between the marker touching the screen and its E-ink appearing. The bezel contained page-forward and page-back buttons, which were unfortunately placed at the bottom of the screen. Your wrist would have a hard time resting without accidentally pressing them.\nOn the ReMarkable 2, both flaws have been swept away. There is now a mere 20-millisecond wait for the ink to appear, a crucial threshold; to the human eye, it is immediate. The processor is twice as fast. Drawing on the tablet can be much more precise. Writing is more of a joy. (You can also do it for longer, given that the battery now reportedly lasts for two weeks instead of three days — I didn't get close to exhausting it — and recharges via USB-C rather than MicroUSB.) \nAs for the buttons on the bezel, they're gone. Now, you move between pages by swiping left or right. A single on-off button sits atop a thin silver strip on the left side of the tablet, a cool design that beats the cheaper, more plastic feel of the original. Combined with the world-record thinness of the ReMarkable 2, which is a mere 0.19 inches deep (versus 0.27 inches for its predecessor), the overall impression is of a magic legal pad from the 23rd century.\nIndeed, even though the Remarkable 2 is a shade heavier than its predecessor (405 grams versus 350 grams), the thinner, shorter design somehow helps it feel lighter. I was fond of writing on my lap while propping the top of the device up with a single finger. That's not something I could ever do with my iPad. \n\nSpeaking of the iPad, the ReMarkable 2 has taken a leaf out of Apple's book and filled up with magnets. The Remarkable stylus now clicks satisfyingly onto the side of the tablet — well, not quite as satisfyingly as the Apple Pencil sticks to the iPad Pro, but close. There's a key difference between the two markers that ReMarkable sells. The free one felt much more magnetic and re&#xadassuringly solid than the Marker Plus, which has an end that acts like an eraser. \nThe silver strip, meanwhile, magnetically attaches to a $69 folio case. However, I found the case useful only for storage; when writing, the cover was too stiff to bend back all the way, while the back added unnecessary bulk. Something like Apple's iPad smart cover, which folds back into a highly graspable triangular shape, would work wonders here.\nReMarkable's software, meanwhile, continues to improve by leaps and bounds. It now offers a variety of templates for each page, including storyboards, comics panels, and day planners. You can still upload PDF and EPUB files, mark them up, and save them to the ReMarkable cloud, which is accessible via app on smartphones and computers. Document sync (via WiFi) was a little on the slow side, in my experience, but never failed altogether. \nThe device's handwriting recognition is fast and fairly impressive, and I was surprised to find it could even read my cursive script — I grew up learning a fancy style known as copperplate, and it's still in my muscle memory — with relatively few errors. I had to make a dozen or so corrections to this article after converting it, and the errors were at least amusing: \"text\" became \"teat,\" \"feel\" became \"feet.\" This I can work with. \nAnnoyingly, there is only one thing you can do with your words once they've converted, and that is to email them. Sure, it's pretty cool to be able to dash off emails on a magic legal pad, but it would be nicer to be able to store the text. Given that everything else you write is automatically uploaded to the cloud, the lack of converted text storage is a strange omission. \nI had a few other minor gripes about the software. There isn't as much customization of the pen stroke as you'd expect. You only get the option of thin, medium, or thick lines, and it's Goldilocks' choice: thin is too fine for legibility, while thick is too bulky. Only medium is just about right. There's a greater selection of pen style, from mechanical pencil to ballpoint pen and paintbrush. Sometimes the brush strokes came out a little too jagged. Artists may love the ReMarkable 2 for its quick sketching utility but become frustrated if they try to use it as a fine art tool along the lines of an iPad.\nBut in the end, comparing this device to its far more expensive Apple brethren is a little like, well, apples and oranges. The ReMarkable 2 is the little e-ink tablet that would, from a small Norwegian company with big ambitions. The pandemic may have slowed its arrival — originally due to ship mid-summer, pre-orders have been delayed several times and are now expected to ship in September. Still, it is truly remarkable that this device exists at all. If you're looking to rediscover the joys of distraction-free writing by hand in a notebook that is practically infinite, there is nothing else like it on the market. \nHypergraphia, here we come. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1470420%252F7b44be1c-2680-4b7d-b6b5-1d93486a1a2f.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=YOLCC_SGv3naFPgcuDaXjdTrYbg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=ltlOqzMBoeA4fIH9cwVxupB3Ixg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=zlrfc0gbV9-FnLbqJTGdXxNPg9M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=L_2HWkbfCeMOURnNLC5HNFGy_Sc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=iIEqnkkAwYPuBInYzGiMEg2y_6g=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=pfGfsEAPHVPayEcFsMPbdMydZrk=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"ReMarkable 2 review: A magic legal pad from the future","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=zlrfc0gbV9-FnLbqJTGdXxNPg9M=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.webp%252F280x157.webp?signature=-ct7d655e-wn4jUqlTyFlb8OOmo=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.webp%252F356x205.webp?signature=C8tZWWV22Nyu3qTcPUQAj636WwY=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=iIEqnkkAwYPuBInYzGiMEg2y_6g=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F118610%252F4dbec170-6c68-45a3-865f-d12ca672bcbb.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=zlrfc0gbV9-FnLbqJTGdXxNPg9M=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"ReMarkable 2 review: A magic legal pad from the future","choice":true,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"productreview":[{"id":1470149,"data-id":1470149,"data-template":"default","data-product-url":"https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2","data-product-price":399,"data-product-name":"ReMarkable 2","data-product-good":"Stylus is magnetic,Slimmer, better design than its predecessor,Writing appears faster","data-product-bad":"Handwriting-to-text can't be edited,Folio cover isn't ideal,Limited usability for artists","data-product-blurb":"The world's first e-ink tablet has shed its flaws and is ready for prime time.","data-product-score":"4.75","data-product-coolness":5,"data-product-curve":"4.5","data-product-performance":"4.5","data-product-value":5,"data-product-score-title":"⚡ Mashable Score","data-product-coolness-title":"😎 Cool Factor","data-product-curve-title":"📘Learning Curve","data-product-performance-title":"💪Performance","data-product-bang-for-the-buck-title":"💵Bang for the Buck","class":"content-productreview"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"The world's first e-ink tablet is now thinner, faster, and finally ready for prime time.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"ReMarkable 2 review: A magic legal pad from the future"}]
